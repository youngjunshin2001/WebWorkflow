<h2>1.0 History</h2>
   <p>The discovery of mTOR was  made a few decades ago while investigating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action" title="Mechanism of action">mechanism  of action</a> of  its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor" title="Enzyme inhibitor">inhibitor</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapamycin" title="Rapamycin">rapamycin</a>. Rapamycin was first discovered in 1975 in a  soil sample from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island" title="Easter Island">Easter Island</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania" title="Oceania">South Pacific</a>, also known as Rapa Nui, from where its name is  derived. Rapamycin is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide" title="Macrolide">macrolide</a>, produced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism" title="Microorganism">microorganism</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomyces_hygroscopicus" title="Streptomyces hygroscopicus">Streptomyces  hygroscopicus</a> and  showed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication" title="Antifungal medication">antifungal</a>properties. Shortly after its  discovery, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug" title="Immunosuppressive drug">immunosuppressive</a> properties were detected, which  later led to the establishment of rapamycin as an immunosuppressant. In the  1980s, rapamycin was also found to have anticancer activity although the exact  mechanism of action remained unknown until many years later. In the 1990s there was a  dramatic change in this field due to studies on the mechanism of action of  rapamycin and the identification of the drug target. It was found that  rapamycin inhibited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth" title="Cell growth">cellular proliferation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle" title="Cell cycle">cell cycle progression</a>. Research on mTOR inhibition has been a  growing branch in science and has promising results.</p>
   
   <h2>2.0 Protein kinases and their inhibitors</h2>
   <p>In general, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase" title="Protein kinase">protein kinases are classified in two major categories based  on their substrate specificity, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase" title="Tyrosine kinase">protein tyrosine kinases</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine/threonine-specific_protein_kinase" title="Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase">protein serine/threonine kinases</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-specificity_kinase" title="Dual-specificity kinase">Dual-specificity  kinases</a> are subclass  of the tyrosine kinases. mTOR is a kinase within the family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol_3-kinase-related_kinase" title="Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase">phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-related kinases  (PIKKs)</a> which is a family of serine/threonine  protein kinases, with a sequence similarity to the family of lipid  kinases, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoinositide_3-kinase" title="Phosphoinositide 3-kinase">PI3Ks</a>. These kinases have different  biological functions, but are all large proteins with common domain  structure.<img src="images/img/Domain_structure_of_mTOR.png" alt="Domain_structure_of_mTOR" width="472" height="130" class="img-responsive" border="0" style="float: left; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 20px;"></a>The four domains of mTOR at  the protein level. PIKKs have four domains at  the protein level, which distinguish them from other protein kinases. From  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-terminus" title="N-terminus">N-terminus</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-terminus" title="C-terminus">C-terminus</a>, these domains are named FRAP-ATM-TRAAP  (FAT), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_domain" title="Protein kinase domain">the  kinase domain</a> (KD),  the PIKK-regulatory domain (PRD), and the FAT-C-terminal (FATC). The FAT  domain, consisting of four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix" title="Alpha helix">α-helices</a>, is N-terminal to KD, but that part is referred  to as the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain, which binds the  FKBP12-rapamycin complex. The FAT domain consists of repeats, referred to  as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEAT_repeat_domain" title="HEAT repeat domain">HEAT</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtin" title="Huntingtin">Huntingtin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongation_factor" title="Elongation factor">Elongation factor 3</a>, A subunit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_phosphatase_2" title="Protein phosphatase 2">protein  phosphatase 2A</a> and  TOR1). Specific protein activators regulate the PIKK kinases but binding  of them to the kinase complex causes a conformational change that increases  substrate access to the kinase domain. Protein kinases have become  popular drug targets. They have been targeted for the discovery and design  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_molecule" title="Small molecule">small  molecule</a>inhibitors and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic_medical_product" title="Biologic medical product">biologics</a> as potential therapeutic agents.  Small-molecule inhibitors of protein kinases generally prevent either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation" title="Phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> of proteins <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)" title="Enzyme substrate (biology)">substrates</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophosphorylation" title="Autophosphorylation">autophosphorylation</a> of the kinase itself.</p>

  <h3>3.1 mTOR signaling pathway in human cancer</h3>
  <p><img src="images/img/MTOR_signal_pathway.jpg" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/MTOR_signal_pathway.jpg/220px-MTOR_signal_pathway.jpg" width="500" height="683" class="img-responsive" border="0" style="float: left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 20px;"> Many human tumors occur  because of dysregulation of mTOR signaling, and can confer higher  susceptibility to inhibitors of mTOR. Deregulations of multiple elements  of the mTOR pathway, like PI3K <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplification_(molecular_biology)" title="Amplification (molecular biology)">amplification</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation" title="Mutation">mutation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)" title="PTEN (gene)">PTEN</a> loss of function, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT" title="AKT">AKT</a> overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIF4E" title="EIF4E">eIF4E</a> overexpression have been related to many types of cancers. Therefore,  mTOR is an interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target" title="Biological target">therapeutic target</a> for treating multiple cancers, both  the mTOR inhibitors themselves or in combination with inhibitors of other  pathways. Upstream, PI3K/AKT  signalling is deregulated through a variety of mechanisms, including  overexpression or activation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor" title="Growth factor receptor">growth  factor receptors</a>, such  as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER-2" title="HER-2">HER-2</a> (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor" title="Insulin-like growth factor">IGFR</a> (insulin-like growth factor  receptor), mutations in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PI3K" title="PI3K">PI3K</a> and mutations/amplifications of  AKT. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)" title="PTEN (gene)">Tumor suppressor  phosphatase and tensin homologue</a>deleted on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_10" title="Chromosome 10">chromosome 10</a> (PTEN) is a negative regulator of  PI3K signaling.

Downstream, the mTOR  effectors S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIF4EBP1" title="EIF4EBP1">eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1  (4EBP1)</a> and  eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) are related to cellular transformation.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR_inhibitors#cite_note-populo-1">[1]</a> S6K1 is a key regulator of cell growth and  also phosphorylates other important targets. Both eIF4E and S6K1 are included  in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)" title="Transformation (genetics)">cellular  transformation</a> and  their overexpression has been linked to poor cancer prognosis.</p>
  
  <h2>4.0 Development  of mTOR inhibitors</h2>
  <p>Since the discovery of mTOR,  much research has been done on the subject, using rapamycin and rapalogs to  understand its biological functions. The clinical results from targeting  this pathway were not as straight forward as thought at first. Those results  have changed the course of clinical research in this field. Initially,  rapamycin was developed as an antifungal drug against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans" title="Candida albicans">Candida albicans</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_fumigatus" title="Aspergillus fumigatus">Aspergillus  fumigatus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus_neoformans" title="Cryptococcus neoformans">Cryptococcus  neoformans</a>. Few  years later its immunosuppressive properties were detected. Later studies led  to the establishment of rapamycin as a major immunosuppressant against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection" title="Transplant rejection">transplant  rejection</a>, along  with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclosporine_A" title="Cyclosporine A">cyclosporine  A</a>. By using  rapamycin in combination with cyclosporin A, it enhanced the rejection prevention  in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_transplantation" title="Renal transplantation">renal  transplantation</a>.  Therefore, it was possible to use lower doses of cyclosporine which  minimized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity" title="Toxicity">toxicity</a> of the drug. In the 1980s rapamycin was evaluated by the  Developmental Therapeutic Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). It was  discovered that rapamycin had an anticancer activity and was a non-cytotoxic  agent with cytostatic activity against several human cancer types.] However,  due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties, the development of mTOR  inhibitors for the treatment of cancer was not successful at that  time. Since then, rapamycin has also shown to be effective for preventing  coronary artery <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restenosis" title="Restenosis">re-stenosis</a> and for the treatment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegenerative_diseases" title="Neurodegenerative diseases">neurodegenerative  diseases</a></p>
  
  <h2>4.1 First generation mTOR  inhibitors</h2>
  <p>The development of rapamycin  as an anticancer agent began again in the 1990s with the discovery of  temsirolimus (CCI-779). This was a novel soluble rapamycin derivative that had  a favorable toxicological profile in animals. More rapamycin derivatives with  improved pharmacokinetics and reduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive" title="Immunosuppressive">immunosuppressive</a> effects have since then been developed for  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy" title="Chemotherapy">treatment of  cancer</a>. These  rapalogs include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temsirolimus" title="Temsirolimus">temsirolimus</a> (CCI-779), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everolimus" title="Everolimus">everolimus</a> (RAD001),  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridaforolimus" title="Ridaforolimus">ridaforolimus</a> (AP-23573) which are being evaluated  in cancer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial" title="Clinical trial">clinical  trials</a>. Rapamycin  analogs have similar therapeutic effects as rapamycin. However they have  improved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophile" title="Hydrophile">hydrophilicity</a> and can be used for oral and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy" title="Intravenous therapy">intravenous  administration</a>. In  2012 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute" title="National Cancer Institute">National  Cancer Institute</a> listed  more than 200 clinical trials testing the anticancer activity of rapalogs both  as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotherapy" title="Monotherapy">monotherapy</a> or as a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy" title="Combination therapy">combination  therapy</a> for many  cancer types. Rapalogs, which are the  first generation mTOR inhibitors, have proven effective in a range of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preclinical" title="Preclinical">preclinical</a> models. However, the success in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trials" title="Clinical trials">clinical trials</a> is limited to only a few rare  cancers. Animal and clinical studies show that rapalogs are  primarily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytostatic" title="Cytostatic">cytostatic</a>, and therefore effective as disease  stabilizers rather than for regression. The response rate in solid tumors  where rapalogs have been used as a single-agent therapy have been modest. Due  to partial mTOR inhibition as mentioned before, rapalogs are not sufficient for  achieving a broad and robust anticancer effect, at least when used as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotherapy" title="Monotherapy">monotherapy</a>. Another reason for the  limited success is that there is a feedback loop between mTORC1 and AKT in  certain tumor cells. It seems that mTORC1 inhibition by rapalogs fails to  repress a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback" title="Negative feedback">negative  feedback</a> loop that  results in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation" title="Phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> and activation of AKT. These  limitations have led to the development of the second generation of mTOR  inhibitors.</p>
  
 <h2>4.2 Rapamycin and  rapalogs</h2>
  <p>Rapamycin and rapalogs  (rapamycin derivatives) are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_molecule" title="Small molecule">small molecule inhibitors</a>, which have been evaluated as  anticancer agents. The rapalogs have more favorable pharmacokinetic profile  compared to rapamycin, the parent drug, despite the same binding sites for  mTOR and FKBP12. <img src="images/img/Sirolimus_and_temsirolimus.svg.png" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Sirolimus_and_temsirolimus.svg/400px-Sirolimus_and_temsirolimus.svg.png" width="512" height="256" class="img-responsive" border="0"></p>
     
 <h4>4.2.1 Sirolimus</h4>
  <p>The natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial" title="Antibacterial">antibiotic</a>, rapamycin or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus" title="Sirolimus">sirolimus</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytostasis" title="Cytostasis">cytostatic agent</a>, has been used in combination therapy with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroids" title="Corticosteroids">corticosteroids</a>and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclosporine" title="Cyclosporine">cyclosporine</a>in patients who received<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation" title="Kidney transplantation">kidney  transplantation</a>to  prevent<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_rejection" title="Organ rejection">organ  rejection</a>both in  the USand Europe,due to its unsatisfying pharmacokinetic properties.In  2003, the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="U.S. Food and Drug Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a>approved sirolimus-eluting coronary stents, which are used in  patients with narrowing of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_arteries" title="Coronary arteries">coronary arteries</a>, or so-called<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis" title="Atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a>. Recently rapamycin has shown  effective in the inhibition of growth of several human cancers and murine cell  lines.Rapamycin is the main mTOR inhibitor, but deforolimus (AP23573),  everolimus (RAD001), and temsirolimus (CCI-779), are the newly developed  rapamycin analogs.</p>
  
  <h4>4.2.2 Temsirolimus</h4>
  <p>The rapamycin analog, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temsirolimus" title="Temsirolimus">temsirolimus</a> (CCI-779) is  also a noncytotoxic agent which delays tumor proliferation.

   <h3>4.3 Second generation  mTOR inhibitors</h3>
   <p><img src="images/img/Dual_inhibitors.jpg" alt="Dual_inhibitors" width="415" height="400" class="img-responsive" border="0" style="float: left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 20px;" > Action point of first and  second generation mTOR inhibitors on PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The second generation of  mTOR inhibitors is known as ATP-competitive mTOR kinase  inhibitors. mTORC1/mTORC2 dual inhibitors are designed to compete with ATP  in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic" title="Catalytic">catalytic</a>site  of mTOR. They inhibit all of the kinase-dependent functions of mTORC1 and  mTORC2 and therefore, block the feedback activation of PI3K/AKT signaling,  unlike rapalogs that only target mTORC1. These types of inhibitors have  been developed and several of them are being tested in clinical trials. Like  rapalogs, they decrease protein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)" title="Translation (biology)">translation</a>, attenuate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle" title="Cell cycle">cell cycle</a> progression, and inhibit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis" title="Angiogenesis">angiogenesis</a> in many cancer cell lines and also in human  cancer. In fact they have been proven to be more potent than rapalogs. Theoretically,  the most important advantages of these mTOR inhibitors is the considerable  decrease of AKT phosphorylation on mTORC2 blockade and in addition to a better  inhibition on mTORC1. However, some drawbacks exist. Even though these  compounds have been effective in rapamycin-insensitive cell lines, they have  only shown limited success in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS" title="KRAS">KRAS</a> driven tumors. This suggests that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy" title="Combination therapy">combinational</a> therapy may be necessary for the  treatment of these cancers. Another drawback is also their potential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity" title="Toxicity">toxicity</a>. These facts have raised concerns about the long term efficacy of these  types of inhibitors.The close interaction of  mTOR with the PI3K pathway has also led to the development of mTOR/PI3K dual  inhibitors. Compared with drugs that inhibit either mTORC1 or PI3K, these  drugs have the benefit of inhibiting mTORC1, mTORC2, and all the  catalytic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoforms" title="Isoforms">isoforms</a> of PI3K. Targeting both kinases at  the same time reduces the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upregulation" title="Upregulation">upregulation</a> of PI3K, which is typically produced with an  inhibition on mTORC1. The inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway has been  shown to potently block proliferation by inducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase" title="G1 phase">G1</a> arrest in different tumor cell lines. Strong induction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis" title="Apoptosis">apoptosis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy" title="Autophagy">autophagy</a> has also been seen. Despite good promising  results, there are preclinical evidence that some types of cancers may be  insensitive to this dual inhibition. The dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are also  likely to have increased toxicity.</p>

It inhibits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell" title="T cell">T-cell</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth" title="Cell growth">proliferation</a> and proliferative responses induced by  several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine" title="Cytokine">cytokines</a>, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_1_family" title="Interleukin 1 family">interleukin  1 (IL-1)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2" title="Interleukin 2">IL-2</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_3" title="Interleukin 3">IL-3</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4" title="Interleukin 4">IL-4</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6" title="Interleukin 6">IL-6</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor" title="Insulin-like growth factor">IGF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-derived_growth_factor" title="Platelet-derived growth factor">PDGF</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony-stimulating_factor" title="Colony-stimulating factor">colony-stimulating  factors (CSFs)</a>. Rapamycin inhibitors and rapalogs can target  tumor growth both directly and indirectly. Direct impact of them on cancer  cells depend on the concentration of the drug and certain cellular  characteristics. The indirect way, is based on interaction with processes  required for tumor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis" title="Angiogenesis">angiogenesis</a></p>
   
   <h3>5.1 Effects in cancer  cells</h3>
   <p><img src="images/img/Effects_of_Rapamycin_and_its_rapalogs_in_cancer_cells.png" alt="Effects_of_Rapamycin_and_its_rapalogs_in_cancer_cells.png/400px-Effects_of_Rapamycin_and_its_rapalogs_in_cancer_cells" width="596" height="395" class="img-responsive" border="0" style="float: left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 20px;">Effects of Rapamycin and  rapalogs in cancer cells. Rapamycin and rapalogs  crosslink the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunophilins" title="Immunophilins">immunophilin</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FKBP5" title="FKBP5">FK506</a> binding protein, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus" title="Tacrolimus">tacrolimus</a> or FKBP-12, through its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoxy" title="Methoxy">methoxy group</a>. The rapamycin-FKBP12 complex interferes with FRB  domain of mTOR. Molecular interaction between FKBP12, mTOR, and rapamycin  can last for about three days (72 hours). The inhibition of mTOR blocks the  binding of the accessory protein raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR)  to mTOR, but that is necessary for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)" title="Upstream and downstream (DNA)">downstream</a> phosphorylation  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P70-S6_Kinase_1" title="P70-S6 Kinase 1">S6K1</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIF4EBP1" title="EIF4EBP1">4EBP1</a>. As a consequence, S6K1  dephosphorylates, which reduces protein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis" title="Protein biosynthesis">synthesis</a> and decreases cell motality and  size. Rapamycin induces dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 as well, resulting in an  increase in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDKN1B" title="CDKN1B">p27</a> and a decrease in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D1" title="Cyclin D1">cyclin D1</a> expression. That leads to late blockage of  G1/S <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle" title="Cell cycle">cell cycle</a>. Rapamycin has shown to induce cancer  cell death by stimulating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy" title="Autophagy">autophagy</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis" title="Apoptosis">apoptosis</a>, but the molecular mechanism of apoptosis in  cancer cells has not yet been fully resolved. One suggestion of the relation  between mTOR inhibition and apoptosis might be through the downstream target  S6K1, which can phosphorylate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_death_promoter" title="Bcl-2-associated death promoter">BAD</a>, a pro-apoptotic  molecule, on Ser136.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR_inhibitors#cite_note-Faivre-5">[5]</a> That reaction breaks the binding of BAD  to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-xL" title="Bcl-xL">BCL-XL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2" title="Bcl-2">BCL2</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion" title="Mitochondrion">mitochondrial</a> death inhibitors, resulting in  inactivation of BAD and decreased cell survival. Rapamycin has  also shown to induce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53" title="P53">p53</a>-independent apoptosis in certain types of  cancer.</p>
     
   <h3>5.2 Effects on tumor  angiogenesis</h3>
   <p><img border="0" width="393" height="314" src="images/img/Effects_of_Rapamycin_and_rapalogs_on_endothelial_and_tumor_cells.png" alt="Effects_of_Rapamycin_and_rapalogs_on_endothelial_and_tumor_cells" style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 20px;">Effects of Rapamycin and  rapalogs on endothelial and tumor cells. Tumor angiogenesis rely on  interactions between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor" title="Vascular endothelial growth factor">endothelial vascular growth factors</a> which can all activate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PI3K/AKT/mTOR_pathway" title="PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway">PI3K/AKT/mTOR</a> in endothelial cells, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericyte" title="Pericyte">pericytes</a>, or cancer cells. Example of these growth factors  are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiopoietin_1" title="Angiopoietin 1">angiopoietin  1 (ANG1)</a>, ANG 2, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_fibroblast_growth_factor" title="Basic fibroblast growth factor">basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFNB2" title="EFNB2">ephrin-B2</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor" title="Vascular endothelial growth factor">vascular enothelial growth factor (VEGF)</a>, and members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGF_beta" title="TGF beta">tumor growth factor-β (TGFβ)</a> superfamily. One of the major  stimuli of angiogenesis is hypoxia, resulting in activation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors" title="Hypoxia-inducible factors">hypoxia-inducible  transcription factors (HIFs)</a> and expression of ANG2, bFGF, PDGF, VEGF, and VEGFR. Inhibition of  HIF1α translation by preventing PDGF/PDGFR and VEGF/VEGFR can result from mTOR  inhibition. A G0-G1 cell-cycle blockage can be the consequence of inactivation  of mTOR in hypoxia-activated pericytes and endothelial cells. There are some evidence that  extended therapy with rapamycin may have effect on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT" title="AKT">AKT</a> and mTORC2 as well.</p>
     
   <h2>6.0 Structure  activity relationship</h2>
   <p>The pipecolate region of  rapamycin structure seems necessary for rapamycin-binding to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FKBP1A" title="FKBP1A">FKBP12</a>. This step is required for further binding of rapamycin to the mTOR  kinase, which is the key enzyme in many biological actions of rapamycin. The high affinity of  rapamycin binding to FKBP12 is explained by number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond" title="Hydrogen bond">hydrogen bonds</a> through two different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe" title="Hydrophobe">hydrophobic</a> binding pockets, and this has been revealed  by X-ray crystal structure of the compound bound to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a>. The structural characteristics common to temsirolimus and sirolimus;  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipecolic_acid" title="Pipecolic acid">pipecolic  acid</a>, tricarbonyl region  from C13-C15, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactone" title="Lactone">lactone</a> functionalities play the key role in  binding groups with the FKBP12. The most important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bonds" title="Hydrogen bonds">hydrogen bonds</a> are the lactone carbonyl oxygen at C-21 to  the backbone NH of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine" title="Isoleucine">Ile56</a>, amide carbonyl at C-15 to the phenolic group on the sidechain of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine" title="Tyrosine">Tyr82</a>, and the hydroxyl proton at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiketal" title="Hemiketal">hemiketal</a> carbon, C-13, to the sidechain of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagine" title="Asparagine">Asp37</a>.<img src="images/img/Sirolimus_binding_sites.svg.png" alt="Sirolimus_binding_sites" width="300" height="279" class="img-responsive" border="0" style="float: left; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 20px;"> <strong>Binding sites of  rapamycin</strong>: Green ring  (pipecolate region) represents binding region to FKBP12 and purple ring  represents binding region to mTOR. Structural changes to the  rapamycin structure can affect binding to mTOR. This could include both direct  and indirect binding as a part of binding to FKBP12. Interaction of the  FKBP12-rapamycin complex with mTOR corresponds with conformational flexibility  of the effector domain of rapamycin. This domain consists of molecular regions  that make hydrophobic interactions with the FKB domain and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyene" title="Polyene">triene</a> region  from C-1-C-6, methoxy group at C-7, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group" title="Methyl group">methyl groups</a> at C-33, C-27 and C-25. All changes of the  macrolide ring can have unpredictible effects on binding and therefore, make  determination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure-activity_relationship" title="Structure-activity relationship">SAR</a> for rapalogs  problematic. Rapamycin contains no functional groups that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization" title="Ionization">ionize</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH" title="PH">pH</a> range 1-10 and therefore, are rather  insoluble in water. Despite its effectiveness in preclinic cancer models,  its poor solubility in water, stability, and the long half-life elimination  made its parenteral use difficult, but the development of soluble rapamycin  analogs vanquished various barriers. Nonetheless, the rapamycin  analogs that have been approved for human use are modified at C-43 hydroxyl  group and show improvement in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics" title="Pharmacokinetics">pharmacokinetic</a> parameters as well as drug properties, for  example solubility. Rapamycin and temsirolimus have similar chemical  structures and bind to FKBP12, though their mechanism of action differs. Temsirolimus  is a dihydroxymethyl propionic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid" title="Acid">acid</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester" title="Ester">ester</a> of rapamycin, and its first  derivative. Therefore, it is more water-soluble, and due to its  watersolubility it can be given by intravenous formulation. Everolimus has O-2  hydroxyethyl chain substitution and deforolimus has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphine_oxide" title="Phosphine oxide">phosphine oxide</a> substitution at position C-43 in the lactone  ring of rapamycin. Deforolimus (Ridaforolimus )  has C43 secondary alcohol moiety of the cyclohexyl group of Rapamycin that was  substituted with phosphonate and phosphinate groups, preventing the  high-affinity binding to mTOR and FKBP. Computational modelling studies helped  the synthesise of the compound.</p>
     
   <h2>7.0 Adverse  events</h2>
   <p>Treatment with mTOR  inhibitors can be complicated by adverse events. The most frequently occurring  adverse events are stomatitis, rash, anemia, fatigue,  hyperglycemia/hypertriglyceridemia, decreased appetite, nausea, and diarrhea.  Additionally, interstitial lung disease is an adverse event of particular  importance. mTORi-induced ILD often is asymptomatic (with ground glass  abnormalities on chest CT) or mild symptomatic (with a non-productive cough),  but can be very severe as well. Even fatalities have been described. Careful  diagnosis and treatment therefore is essential. Recently, a new diagnostic and  therapeutic management approach has been proposed.</p>
   
   <h2>8.0 Biomarkers</h2>
   <p>Identification of  predictive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker" title="Biomarker">biomarkers</a> of efficacy for tumor types that are  sensitive to mTOR inhibitors remains a major issue.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR_inhibitors#cite_note-populo-1">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR_inhibitors#cite_note-Delbado-38">[38]</a> Possible predictive biomarkers for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors#Response_Criteria" title="Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors">tumor response</a> to mTOR inhibitors, as have been described  in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma" title="Glioblastoma">glioblastoma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer" title="Breast cancer">breast</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer" title="Prostate cancer">prostate cancer</a> cells, may be the differential expression of  mTOR pathway proteins, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)" title="PTEN (gene)">PTEN</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT" title="AKT">AKT</a>, and S6. Thus, this data is based on preclinical assays, based  on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro" title="In vitro">in vitro</a> cultured tumor cell lines, which suggest  that the effects of mTOR inhibitors may be more pronounced in cancers  displaying loss of PTEN functions or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIK3CA" title="PIK3CA">PIK3CA</a> mutations. However, the use of PTEN, PIK3CA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation" title="Mutation">mutations</a>, and AKT–phospho status for predicting rapalog  sensitivity has not been fully validated in clinic. To date, attempts to  identify biomarkers of rapalog response have been unsuccessful.</p>
   
   <h3>8.1 Sensitivity</h3>
   <p>Clinical and translational  data suggest that sensitive tumor types, with adequate parameters and  functional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis" title="Apoptosis">apoptosis</a> pathways, might not need high doses  of mTOR inhibitors to trigger apoptosis. In most cases, cancer cells might only  be partially sensitive to mTOR inhibitors due to redundant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction" title="Signal transduction">signal  transduction</a> or lack  of functional apoptosis signaling pathways. In situations like this, high doses  of mTOR inhibitors might be required. In recent study of patients with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma" title="Renal cell carcinoma">Renal  cell carcinoma</a>,  resistance to Temsirolimus was associated with low levels of p-AKT and p-S6K1,  that play the key role in mTOR activation. These data strongly suggests number of  tumors with an activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway that does not respond  to mTOR inhibitors. For future studies it is recommended to exclude patients  with low or negative p-AKT levels from trials with mTOR inhibitors. Current data is insufficient  to predict sensitivity of tumors to rapamycin. However, the existing data  allows us to characterize tumors that might not respond to rapalogs.</p>
   
   <h2>9.0 ATP-competitive  mTOR kinase inhibitors</h2>
   <p>These second generation mTOR inhibitors bind to ATP-binding site in mTOR kinase domain required for the functions of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, and result in downregulation of mTOR signaling pathway. Due to PI3K and mTORC2 ability to regulate AKT phosphorylation, these two compounds play a key role in minimizing the feedback activation of AKT.</p>
   
   <h3>9.1 mTOR/PI3K dual  inhibitors</h3>
   <p><img border="0" width="200" height="150" src="images/img/Dactolisib.svg.png" alt="Dactolisib" class="img-responsive" style="float: left; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 20px;">Several, so-called mTOR/PI3K  dual inhibitors (TPdIs), have been developed and are in early-stage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development" title="Pre-clinical development">preclinical  trials</a> and show  promising results. Their development has been benefited from previous studies  with PI3K-selective inhibitors.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR_inhibitors#cite_note-ZHANG2011-20">[20]</a> The activity of these small molecules from  rapalog activity differs in the way by blocking both mTORC1-dependent  phospholylation of S6K1 and mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of AKT Ser473  residue. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactolisib" title="Dactolisib">Dactolisib</a> chemical structure. Dual mTOR/PI3K inhibitors  include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactolisib" title="Dactolisib">dactolisib</a>, BGT226, SF1126, PKI-587 and many more. For  example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis" title="Novartis">Novartis</a> has developed the compound NVPBE235  that was reported to inhibit tumor growth in various preclinical models. It  enhances antitumor activity of some other drugs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine" title="Vincristine">vincristine</a>. Dactolisib seems to inhibit effectively  both wild-type and mutant form of PI3KCA, which suggests its use towards wide  types of tumors. Studies have shown superior antiproliferative activity to  rapalogs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo" title="In vivo">in vivo</a> models have confirmed these potent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antineoplastic" title="Antineoplastic">antineoplastic</a> effects of dual mTOR/PI3K inhibitors. These  inhibitors target <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoforms" title="Isoforms">isoforms</a> of PI3K (p110α, β and γ) along with  ATP-binding sites of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by blocking PI3K/AKT signaling, even in  cancer types with mutations in this pathway.</p>
   
   <h3>9.2 mTORC1/mTORC2 dual  inhibitors (TORCdIs)</h3>
   <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sapanisertib.svg"><img src="images/img/mTOR inhibitors_clip_image012.png" alt="Sapanisertib" width="190" height="105" class="img-responsive" border="0" style="float: left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 20px;"></a> Sapanisertib (INK-128):  chemical structure
   New mTOR-specific inhibitors  came forth from screening and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery" title="Drug discovery">drug discovery</a> efforts. These compounds block activity of  both mTOR complexes and are called mTORC1/mTORC2 dual  inhibitors. Compounds with this characteristics such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapanisertib" title="Sapanisertib">sapanisertib</a> (codenamed  INK128), AZD8055, and AZD2014 have entered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial" title="Clinical trial">clinical trials</a>. A series of these mTOR kinase inhibitors have  been studied. Their structure is derived from morpholino pyrazolopyrimidine  scaffold. Improvements of this type of inhibitors have been made by  exchanging the morpholines with bridged morpholines in pyrazolopyrimidine  inhibitors and results showed increased selectivity to mTOR by 26000 fold.</p>
     
   <h3>9.3 Limitations of new  generation mTOR inhibitors</h3>
   <p>Although the new generation  of mTOR inhibitors hold great promise for anticancer therapy and are rapidly moving  into clinical trials, there are many important issues that determine their  success in the clinic. First of all predictable biomarkers for benefit of these  inhibitors are not available. It appears that genetic determinants predispose  cancer cells to be sensitive or resistant to these compounds. Tumors that  depend on PI3K/mTOR pathway should respond to these agents but it is unclear if  compounds are effective in cancers with distinct genetic lesions. Inhibition of mTOR is a  promising strategy for treatment of number of cancers. Limited clinical  activity of selective mTORC1 agents have made them unlikely to have impact in  cancer treatment. The development of competitive ATP-catalytic inhibitors has  the ability to block both mTORC1 and mTORC2.</p>
     
   <h2>10.0 Future</h2>
   <p>The limitations of currently  available rapalogs have led to new approaches to mTOR targeting. Studies  suggest that mTOR inhibitors may have anticancer activity in many cancer types,  such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma" title="Renal cell carcinoma">RCC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumors" title="Neuroendocrine tumors">neuroendocrine  tumors</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma" title="Hepatocellular carcinoma">hepatocellular  carcinoma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma" title="Sarcoma">sarcoma</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_B-cell_lymphoma" title="Large B-cell lymphoma">large  B-cell lymphoma</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR_inhibitors#cite_note-Yuan-3">[3]</a> One major limitation for the development of  mTOR inhibition therapy is that biomarkers are not presently available to  predict which patient will respond to them. A better understanding of the  molecular mechanisms that are involved in the response of cancer cells to mTOR  inhibitors are still required so this can be possible. A way to overcome the  resistance and improve efficacy of mTOR targeting agents may be with  stratification of patients and selection of drug combination therapies. This  may lead to a more effective and personalized cancer therapy. Although  further research is needed, mTOR targeting still remains an attractive and  promising therapeutic option for the treatment of cancer.</p>
