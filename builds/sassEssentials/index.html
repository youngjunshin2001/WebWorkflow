     <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_poppies" title="Opium poppies">Opium  poppies</a> such as this one provide ingredients for the class of  analgesics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiates" title="Opiates">opiates</a> An <strong>analgesic</strong> or <strong>painkiller</strong> is  any member of the group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug" title="Pharmaceutical drug">drugs</a> used to achieve analgesia, relief  from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain" title="Pain">pain</a>. Analgesic drugs  act in various ways on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system" title="Peripheral nervous system">peripheral</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system" title="Central nervous system">central</a> nervous systems. They are  distinct from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic" title="Anesthetic">anesthetics</a>, which temporarily affect, and in some  instances completely eliminate, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense" title="Sense">sensation</a>.  Analgesics include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol" title="Paracetamol">paracetamol</a>(known in North America as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaminophen" title="Acetaminophen">acetaminophen</a> or  simply APAP), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug" title="Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs</a> (NSAIDs) such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylate" title="Salicylate">salicylates</a>,  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid" title="Opioid">opioid</a> drugs  such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine" title="Morphine">morphine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone" title="Oxycodone">oxycodone</a>.

   <h2>Classification</h2>
   <h3>Paracetamol (acetaminophen)</h3>
   <p>Paracetamol, also  known as acetaminophen or APAP, is a medication used to treat <a 			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain" title="Pain">pain</a> and <a       ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever" title="Fever">fever</a>. It is typically used for mild to  moderate pain. In combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_analgesic" title="Opioid analgesic">opioid pain medication</a>, paracetamol is used for more severe pain  such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_pain" title="Cancer pain">cancer pain</a> and after surgery.  It is  typically used either by mouth or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectally" title="Rectally">rectally</a> but is also available <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenously" title="Intravenously">intravenously</a>. Effects last between two and four  hours. Paracetamol is classified as a mild analgesic. Paracetamol is  generally safe at recommended doses.</p>
   
   <h3>NSAIDs</h3>
   <p>Nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs (usually abbreviated to NSAIDs), are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_class" title="Drug class">drug class</a> that groups together <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug" title="Drug">drugs</a> that decrease pain and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipyretic" title="Antipyretic">lower fever</a>, and, in higher doses decrease <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation" title="Inflammation">inflammation</a>. The most prominent members of this group of  drugs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin" title="Aspirin">aspirin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen" title="Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen" title="Naproxen">naproxen</a>, are all available <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug" title="Over-the-counter drug">over the  counter</a> in most  countries.</p>
   
   <h3>COX-2  inhibitors</h3>
   <p>These drugs have  been derived from NSAIDs. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase" title="Cyclooxygenase">cyclooxygenase</a> enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs was discovered to  have at least 2 different versions: COX1 and COX2. Research suggested most of  the adverse effects of NSAIDs to be mediated by blocking the COX1 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutive_enzyme" title="Constitutive enzyme">constitutive</a>) enzyme, with the analgesic effects being  mediated by the COX2 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_enzyme" title="Adaptive enzyme">inducible</a>) enzyme. Thus, the COX2 inhibitors were developed  to inhibit only the COX2 enzyme (traditional NSAIDs block both versions in general).  These drugs (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rofecoxib" title="Rofecoxib">rofecoxib</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celecoxib" title="Celecoxib">celecoxib</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoricoxib" title="Etoricoxib">etoricoxib</a>)  are equally effective analgesics when compared with NSAIDs, but cause less  gastrointestinal hemorrhage in particular. After widespread adoption of the  COX-2 inhibitors, it was discovered that most of the drugs in this class increase  the risk of cardiovascular events by 40% on average. This led to the withdrawal  of rofecoxib and valdecoxib, and warnings on others. Etoricoxib seems  relatively safe, with the risk of thrombotic events similar to that of  non-coxib NSAID diclofenac.</p>
   
   <h3>Opioids</h3>
   <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine" title="Morphine">Morphine</a>, the archetypal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid" title="Opioid">opioid</a>, and other opioids (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeine" title="Codeine">codeine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone" title="Oxycodone">oxycodone</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocodone" title="Hydrocodone">hydrocodone</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydromorphine" title="Dihydromorphine">dihydromorphine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pethidine" title="Pethidine">pethidine</a>) all exert a similar influence on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum" title="Cerebrum">cerebral</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_receptor" title="Opioid receptor">opioid  receptor</a> system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine" title="Buprenorphine">Buprenorphine</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_agonist" title="Partial agonist">partial agonist</a> of the μ-opioid receptor, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol" title="Tramadol">tramadol</a> is a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with weak  μ-opioid receptor agonist properties. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol" title="Tramadol">Tramadol</a> is structurally closer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venlafaxine" title="Venlafaxine">venlafaxine</a> than to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeine" title="Codeine">codeine</a> and delivers analgesia by not only delivering &quot;opioid-like&quot;  effects (through mild agonism of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_receptor" title="Mu receptor">mu receptor</a>) but also by acting as a weak but  fast-acting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_releasing_agent" title="Serotonin releasing agent">serotonin  releasing agent</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor" title="Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor">norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapentadol" title="Tapentadol">Tapentadol</a>,  with some structural similarities to tramadol, presents what is believed to be  a novel drug working through two (and possibly three) different modes of action  in the fashion of both a traditional opioid and as a SNRI. The effects of  serotonin and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor" title="Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor">norepinephrine</a> on  pain, while not completely understood, have had causal links established and  drugs in the SNRI class are commonly used in conjunction with opioids  (especially tapentadol and tramadol) with greater success in pain relief.  Dosing of all opioids may be limited by opioid toxicity (confusion, respiratory  depression, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoclonus" title="Myoclonus">myoclonic jerks</a> and pinpoint pupils), seizures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol" title="Tramadol">tramadol</a>), but opioid-tolerant individuals usually have higher dose ceilings than  patients without tolerance. Opioids, while very effective analgesics,  may have some unpleasant side-effects. Patients starting morphine may  experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea" title="Nausea">nausea</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting" title="Vomiting">vomiting</a> (generally relieved by a short course of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiemetic" title="Antiemetic">antiemetics</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenergan" title="Phenergan">phenergan</a>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruritus" title="Pruritus">Pruritus</a> (itching) may require switching to a different opioid. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation" title="Constipation">Constipation</a> occurs in almost all patients on opioids,  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxative" title="Laxative">laxatives</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactulose" title="Lactulose">lactulose</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrogol" title="Macrogol">macrogol</a>-containing or co-danthramer) are typically co-prescribed. When used  appropriately, opioids and other central analgesics are otherwise safe and  effective, however risks such as addiction and the body's becoming used to the  drug (tolerance) can occur. The effect of tolerance means that frequent use of  the drug may result in its diminished effect so, when safe to do so, the dosage  may need to be increased to maintain effectiveness. This may be of particular  concern regarding patients suffering with chronic pain. Opioid tolerance  is often addressed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_rotation" title="Opioid rotation">opioid rotation therapy</a> in which a patient  is routinely switched between two or more non-cross-tolerant opioid medications  in order to prevent exceeding safe dosages in the attempt to achieve an  adequate analgesic effect.</p>
   
   <h3>Alcohol</h3>
   <p>Describing the  effects of using alcohol to treat pain is difficult. Alcohol has  biological, mental, and social effects which influence the consequences of  using alcohol for pain. Moderate use of alcohol can lessen certain types  of pain in certain circumstances. Attempting to use alcohol to treat  pain has also been observed to lead to negative outcomes including excessive  drinking and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_use_disorder" title="Alcohol use disorder">alcohol  use disorder</a>.</p>
   
   <h3>Medical  cannabis</h3>
   <p>Medical cannabis  or medical marijuana, can refer to the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" title="Cannabis (drug)">cannabis</a> and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoids" title="Cannabinoids">cannabinoids</a> to treat disease or improve  symptoms. There is evidence suggesting that cannabis can be used to  treat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain" title="Chronic pain">chronic pain</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms" title="Muscle spasms">muscle spasms</a>; with some trials indicating improved relief of  neuropathic pain over opioids.</p>
   
   <h3>Combinations</h3>
   <p>Analgesics are  frequently used in combination, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol" title="Paracetamol">paracetamol</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeine" title="Codeine">codeine</a> preparations found in many non-prescription pain relievers. They can  also be found in combination with vasoconstrictor drugs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoephedrine" title="Pseudoephedrine">pseudoephedrine</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinus" title="Paranasal sinus">sinus</a>-related preparations, or with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihistamine" title="Antihistamine">antihistamine</a> drugs for allergy sufferers. While the use  of paracetamol, aspirin, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen" title="Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen" title="Naproxen">naproxen</a>, and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAIDS" title="NSAIDS">NSAIDS</a> concurrently with weak to mid-range  opiates (up to about the hydrocodone level) has been said to show beneficial  synergistic effects by combatting pain at multiple sites of  action, several combination analgesic products have been shown to have few  efficacy benefits when compared to similar doses of their individual  components. Moreover, these combination analgesics can often result in  significant adverse events, including accidental overdoses, most often due to  confusion that arises from the multiple (and often non-acting) components of  these combinations.</p>
   
   <h3>Psychotropic  agents</h3>
   <p>Other  psychotropic analgesic agents include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine" title="Ketamine">ketamine</a> (an NMDA receptor antagonist), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonidine" title="Clonidine">clonidine</a> and other α2-adrenoreceptor  agonists, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexiletine" title="Mexiletine">mexiletine</a> and other local anaesthetic  analogues.</p>
   
   <h3>Other drugs (<strong>analgesic adjuvant</strong>)</h3>
   <p>Drugs that have been introduced for uses  other than analgesics are also used in pain management. Both first-generation  (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitriptyline" title="Amitriptyline">amitriptyline</a>) and newer anti-depressants (such  as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duloxetine" title="Duloxetine">duloxetine</a>) are used alongside NSAIDs and opioids  for pain involving nerve damage and similar problems. Other agents directly  potentiate the effects of analgesics, such as using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyzine" title="Hydroxyzine">hydroxyzine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethazine" title="Promethazine">promethazine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carisoprodol" title="Carisoprodol">carisoprodol</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripelennamine" title="Tripelennamine">tripelennamine</a> to increase the pain-killing ability of a given  dose of opioid analgesic. Adjuvant analgesics include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefopam" title="Nefopam">nefopam</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphenadrine" title="Orphenadrine">orphenadrine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin" title="Pregabalin">pregabalin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin" title="Gabapentin">gabapentin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclobenzaprine" title="Cyclobenzaprine">cyclobenzaprine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoscine" title="Hyoscine">hyoscine</a> (scopolamine), and other drugs possessing  anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, as well as  many other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics  to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain,  especially of neuropathic origin.</p>
   <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan" title="Dextromethorphan">Dextromethorphan</a> has been noted to slow the development of  tolerance to opioids and exert additional analgesia by acting upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA" title="NMDA">NMDA</a> receptors; some analgesics such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone" title="Methadone">methadone</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketobemidone" title="Ketobemidone">ketobemidone</a> and perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piritramide" title="Piritramide">piritramide</a> have intrinsic NMDA action.</p>
   <p>High-alcohol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor" title="Liquor">liquor</a>, two forms of which were found in the US Pharmacopoeia up until 1916 and  in common use by physicians well into the 1930s, has been used in the past as  an agent for dulling pain, due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system" title="Central nervous system">CNS</a> depressant effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethyl alcohol</a>, a notable example being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American  Civil War</a>. However,  the ability of alcohol to relieve severe pain is likely inferior to many  analgesics used today (e.g., morphine, codeine). As such, in general, the idea  of alcohol for analgesia is considered a primitive practice in virtually all industrialized  countries today. The use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant" title="Adjuvant">adjuvant</a> analgesics is an important and growing part of the pain-control field  and new discoveries are made practically every year. Many of these drugs combat  the side-effects of opioid analgesics, an added bonus. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihistamines" title="Antihistamines">antihistamines</a> including orphenadrine combat the release of  histamine caused by many opioids. Stimulants such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate" title="Methylphenidate">methylphenidate</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" title="Caffeine">caffeine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedrine" title="Ephedrine">ephedrine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine" title="Dextroamphetamine">dextroamphetamine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine" title="Methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> work against heavy sedation and may elevate mood in distressed  patients as do the antidepressants.The use of medicinal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis" title="Cannabis">cannabis</a> remains a debated issue. In patients with chronic or neuropathic  pain, various other substances may have analgesic properties. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant" title="Tricyclic antidepressant">Tricyclic  antidepressants</a>, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomipramine" title="Clomipramine">clomipramine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitriptyline" title="Amitriptyline">amitriptyline</a>, have been shown to improve pain in what appears  to be a central manner. Nefopam is used in Europe for pain relief with  concurrent opioids. The exact mechanism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine" title="Carbamazepine">carbamazepine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin" title="Gabapentin">gabapentin</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin" title="Pregabalin">pregabalin</a> is similarly unclear, but these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant" title="Anticonvulsant">anticonvulsants</a> are used to treat neuropathic pain with  differing degrees of success. Anticonvulsants are most commonly used for  neuropathic pain as their mechanism of action tends to inhibit pain sensation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flupirtine" title="Flupirtine">Flupirtine</a> is a centrally acting K+ channel opener with  weak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_antagonist" title="NMDA antagonist">NMDA antagonist</a> properties. It is used in Europe for moderate to strong  pain and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine" title="Migraine">migraine</a> and its muscle-relaxant properties.  It has no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticholinergic" title="Anticholinergic">anticholinergic</a> properties and is believed to be  devoid of any activity on dopamine, serotonin, or histamine receptors. It is  not addictive, and tolerance usually does not develop. However, tolerance  may develop in single cases.</p>
 
   <h3>Other uses</h3>
   <p>Topical analgesia  is generally recommended to avoid systemic side-effects. Painful joints, for  example, may be treated with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen" title="Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a>- or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac" title="Diclofenac">diclofenac</a>-containing gel (The labeling for topical  diclofenac has been updated to warn about drug-induced hepatotoxicity.); <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin" title="Capsaicin">capsaicin</a> also is used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_cream" title="Topical cream">topically</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine" title="Lidocaine">Lidocaine</a>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic" title="Anesthetic">anesthetic</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid" title="Glucocorticoid">steroids</a> may be injected into painful joints for  longer-term pain relief. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine" title="Lidocaine">Lidocaine</a> is also used for painful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_sore" title="Mouth sore">mouth sores</a> and to numb areas for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry" title="Dentistry">dental</a> work and minor medical procedures. In February 2007 the FDA notified  consumers and healthcare professionals of the potential hazards of topical  anesthetics entering the blood stream when applied in large doses to the skin  without medical supervision. These topical anesthetics contain anesthetic drugs  such as lidocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, and prilocaine in a cream, ointment,  or gel.</p>
   
   <h2>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</h2>
   <p><strong>Nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs</strong> (<strong>NSAIDs</strong>)  are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_class" title="Drug class">drug class</a> that groups together <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug" title="Drug">drugs</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic" title="Analgesic">reduce pain</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipyretic" title="Antipyretic">decrease fever</a>, and, in higher doses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory" title="Anti-inflammatory">decrease inflammation</a>. Side effects include an increased risk  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_ulcers" title="Stomach ulcers">stomach  ulcers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">heart  attacks</a>. The term <em>nonsteroidal</em> distinguishes  these drugs from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid" title="Steroid">steroids</a>, which, among a broad range of other  effects, have a similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosanoid" title="Eicosanoid">eicosanoid</a>-depressing, anti-inflammatory action. First used  in 1960, the term served to distance these medications from steroids. The most  prominent members of this group of drugs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin" title="Aspirin">aspirin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen" title="Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen" title="Naproxen">naproxen</a>, all available <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug" title="Over-the-counter drug">over  the counter</a> in most  countries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol" title="Paracetamol">Paracetamol</a> (acetaminophen) is generally not  considered an NSAID because it has only little anti-inflammatory activity. It  treats pain mainly by blocking COX-2 mostly in the central nervous system, but  not much in the rest of the body. Most NSAIDs inhibit the activity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase" title="Cyclooxygenase">cyclooxygenase</a>-1 (COX-1) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX-2_inhibitor" title="COX-2 inhibitor">cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)</a>, and thereby the synthesis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandins" title="Prostaglandins">prostaglandins</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboxane" title="Thromboxane">thromboxanes</a>.  It is thought that inhibiting COX-2 leads to the anti-inflammatory, analgesic  and antipyretic effects and that those NSAIDs also inhibiting COX-1,  particularly aspirin, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers in large  doses.</p>
   
   <h3>Adverse effects</h3>
   <p>The widespread  use of NSAIDs has meant that the adverse effects of these drugs have become  increasingly common. Use of NSAIDs increases risk of having a range of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract" title="Human gastrointestinal tract">gastrointestinal</a> (GI)  problems. When NSAIDs are used for pain management after surgery they  cause increased risk of kidney problems. An estimated 10–20% of NSAID patients  experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia" title="Dyspepsia">dyspepsia</a>. In the 1990s high doses of prescription  NSAIDs were associated with serious upper gastrointestinal adverse events,  including bleeding. Over the past decade, deaths associated with gastric  bleeding have declined. NSAIDs, like all drugs, may interact with other  medications. For example, concurrent use of NSAIDs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone_antibiotic" title="Quinolone antibiotic">quinolones</a> may increase the risk of quinolones'  adverse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system" title="Central nervous system">central  nervous system</a> effects,  including seizure. There is an argument over the benefits and risks of NSAIDs  for treating chronic musculoskeletal pain. Each drug has a benefit-risk  profile and balancing the risk of no treatment with  the competing potential risks of various therapies is the clinician's  responsibility.</p>
   
   <h3>Combinational  risk</h3>
   <p>If a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX-2_inhibitor" title="COX-2 inhibitor">COX-2 inhibitor</a> is taken, a traditional NSAID (prescription  or over-the-counter) should not be taken at the same time. In addition,  people on daily aspirin therapy (e.g., for reducing cardiovascular risk) must  be careful if they also use other NSAIDs, as these may inhibit the  cardioprotective effects of aspirin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rofecoxib" title="Rofecoxib">Rofecoxib</a> (Vioxx) was shown to produce significantly  fewer gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction" title="Adverse drug reaction">ADRs</a>) compared with naproxen. This study,  the VIGOR trial, raised the issue of the cardiovascular safety of the coxibs. A  statistically significant increase in the incidence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">myocardial  infarctions</a> was  observed in patients on rofecoxib. Further data, from the APPROVe trial, showed  a statistically significant relative risk of cardiovascular events of 1.97  versus placebo which caused a worldwide withdrawal of rofecoxib in  October 2004. Use of methotrexate together with NSAIDS in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis" title="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid  arthritis</a> is safe,  if adequate monitoring is done.</p>
   
   <h3>Cardiovascular</h3>
   <p>NSAIDs, aside  from aspirin, increase the risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">myocardial  infarction</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke" title="Stroke">stroke</a>. This occurs at least within a week of use. They are not  recommended in those who have had a previous heart attack as they increase the  risk of death or recurrent MI. Evidence indicates that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen" title="Naproxen">naproxen</a> may be the least harmful out of these. NSAIDs aside from (low-dose)  aspirin are associated with a doubled risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure" title="Heart failure">heart failure</a> in people without a history of cardiac  disease. In people with such a history, use of NSAIDs (aside from low-dose  aspirin) was associated with a more than 10-fold increase in heart  failure. If this link is proven causal, researchers estimate that NSAIDs  would be responsible for up to 20 percent of hospital admissions for congestive  heart failure. In people with heart failure, NSAIDs increase mortality risk (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio" title="Hazard ratio">hazard ratio</a>) by approximately 1.2–1.3 for naproxen and  ibuprofen, 1.7 for rofecoxib and celecoxib, and 2.1 for diclofenac. On 9 July  2015, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDA" title="FDA">FDA</a> toughened warnings of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_attack" title="Heart attack">heart attack</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke" title="Stroke">stroke</a> risk associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  (NSAID). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin" title="Aspirin">Aspirin</a> is an NSAID but is not affected by  the new warnings.</p>
   
   <h3>Possible  erectile dysfunction risk</h3>
   <p>A 2005 Finnish  study linked long term (over 3 months) use of NSAIDs with an increased risk  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction" title="Erectile dysfunction">erectile  dysfunction</a>. This  study was correlational only, and depended solely on self-reports  (questionnaires). A 2011 publication in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Journal_of_Urology" title="The Journal of Urology">The  Journal of Urology</a> received  widespread publicity. According to this study, men who used NSAIDs  regularly were at significantly increased risk of erectile dysfunction. A link  between NSAID use and erectile dysfunction still existed after controlling for  several conditions. However, the study was observational and not controlled,  with low original participation rate, potential participation bias, and other  uncontrolled factors. The authors warned against drawing any conclusion  regarding cause.</p>
   
   <h3>Gastrointestinal</h3>
   <p>The main adverse  drug reactions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reactions" title="Adverse drug reactions">ADRs</a>) associated with NSAID use relate to  direct and indirect irritation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract" title="Human gastrointestinal tract">gastrointestinal</a> (GI)  tract. NSAIDs cause a dual assault on the GI tract: the acidic molecules  directly irritate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa" title="Gastric mucosa">gastric mucosa</a>, and inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 reduces the  levels of protective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandins" title="Prostaglandins">prostaglandins</a>. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the GI  tract causes increased gastric acid secretion, diminished bicarbonate  secretion, diminished mucus secretion and diminished trophic effects on  the epithelial mucosa. Clinical NSAID ulcers are related to the systemic  effects of NSAID administration. Such damage occurs irrespective of the route  of administration of the NSAID (e.g., oral, rectal, or parenteral) and can  occur even in patients with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achlorhydria" title="Achlorhydria">achlorhydria</a>. Ulceration risk increases with therapy duration,  and with higher doses. To minimize GI ADRs, it is prudent to use the lowest  effective dose for the shortest period of time—a practice that studies show is  often not followed. Recent studies show that over 50% of patients who take  NSAIDs have sustained some mucosal damage to their small intestine. There are  also some differences in the propensity of individual agents to cause  gastrointestinal ADRs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indomethacin" title="Indomethacin">Indomethacin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoprofen" title="Ketoprofen">ketoprofen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piroxicam" title="Piroxicam">piroxicam</a> appear to have the highest prevalence of  gastric ADRs, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen" title="Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a> (lower doses) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac" title="Diclofenac">diclofenac</a> appear to have lower rates. Certain NSAIDs,  such as aspirin, have been marketed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_coating" title="Enteric coating">enteric-coated</a> formulations that manufacturers claim reduce  the incidence of gastrointestinal ADRs. Similarly, some believe that rectal  formulations may reduce gastrointestinal ADRs. However, consistent with the  systemic mechanism of such ADRs, and in clinical practice, these formulations  have not demonstrated a reduced risk of GI ulceration. Commonly, gastric (but  not necessarily intestinal) adverse effects can be reduced through suppressing  acid production, by concomitant use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump_inhibitor" title="Proton pump inhibitor">proton  pump inhibitor</a>,  e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omeprazole" title="Omeprazole">omeprazole</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esomeprazole" title="Esomeprazole">esomeprazole</a>, or the prostaglandin analog <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol" title="Misoprostol">misoprostol</a>. Misoprostol is itself associated with a high  incidence of gastrointestinal ADRs (diarrhea). While these techniques may be  effective, they are expensive for maintenance therapy.</p>
   
   <h3>Inflammatory  bowel disease</h3>
   <p>NSAIDs should be  used with caution in individuals with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease" title="Inflammatory bowel disease">inflammatory  bowel disease</a> (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" title="Crohn's disease">Crohn's disease</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis" title="Ulcerative colitis">ulcerative  colitis</a>) due to their  tendency to cause gastric bleeding and form ulceration in the gastric lining.</p>
   
   <h3>Rena</h3>
   <p>NSAIDs are also  associated with a fairly high incidence of adverse drug reactions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reactions" title="Adverse drug reactions">ADRs</a>) on the kidney and over time can lead  to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease" title="Chronic kidney disease">chronic  kidney disease</a>. The  mechanism of these kidney ADRs is due to changes in kidney blood flow.  Prostaglandins normally dilate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afferent_arteriole" title="Afferent arteriole">afferent  arterioles</a> of  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus" title="Glomerulus">glomeruli</a>. This helps maintain normal glomerular  perfusion and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerular_filtration_rate" title="Glomerular filtration rate">glomerular  filtration rate</a> (GFR),  an indicator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function" title="Renal function">kidney function</a>. This is particularly important in kidney failure  where the kidney is trying to maintain renal perfusion pressure by elevated angiotensin  II levels. At these elevated levels, angiotensin II also constricts the  afferent arteriole into the glomerulus in addition to the efferent arteriole it  normally constricts. Since NSAIDs block this prostaglandin-mediated effect of  afferent arteriole dilation, particularly in kidney failure, NSAIDs cause  unopposed constriction of the afferent arteriole and decreased RPF (renal  perfusion flow) and GFR. These agents may also cause kidney impairment,  especially in combination with other nephrotoxic agents. Kidney failure is  especially a risk if the patient is also concomitantly taking an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor" title="ACE inhibitor">ACE inhibitor</a> (which removes angiotensin II's  vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole) and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic" title="Diuretic">diuretic</a> (which drops plasma volume, and thereby RPF)—the so-called  &quot;triple whammy&quot; effect. NSAIDs in combination with excessive use  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenacetin" title="Phenacetin">phenacetin</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol" title="Paracetamol">paracetamol</a> (acetaminophen) may lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic_nephropathy" title="Analgesic nephropathy">analgesic  nephropathy</a>.</p>
   
   <h3>Photosensitivity</h3>
   <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodermatitis" title="Photodermatitis">Photosensitivity</a> is a commonly overlooked adverse  effect of many of the NSAIDs. The 2-arylpropionic acids are the most  likely to produce photosensitivity reactions, but other NSAIDs have also been  implicated including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piroxicam" title="Piroxicam">piroxicam</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac" title="Diclofenac">diclofenac</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzydamine" title="Benzydamine">benzydamine</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoxaprofen" title="Benoxaprofen">Benoxaprofen</a>, since withdrawn due to its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity" title="Hepatotoxicity">liver toxicity</a>, was the most photoactive NSAID observed. The  mechanism of photosensitivity, responsible for the high photoactivity of the  2-arylpropionic acids, is the ready <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decarboxylation" title="Decarboxylation">decarboxylation</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxylic_acid" title="Carboxylic acid">carboxylic acid</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group" title="Functional group">moiety</a>. The specific absorbance characteristics of the  different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromophore" title="Chromophore">chromophoric</a> 2-aryl substituents, affects the  decarboxylation mechanism. While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen" title="Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a> has weak absorption, it has been reported as  a weak photosensitising agent.</p>
   
   <h3>During  pregnancy</h3>
   <p>NSAIDs are not  recommended during pregnancy, particularly during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_trimester" title="Third trimester">third trimester</a>. While NSAIDs as a class are not direct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratogen" title="Teratogen">teratogens</a>, they may cause premature closure of the  fetal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_arteriosus" title="Ductus arteriosus">ductus  arteriosus</a> and  kidney ADRs in the fetus. Additionally, they are linked with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_birth" title="Premature birth">premature birth</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. Aspirin, however, is used together  with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin" title="Heparin">heparin</a> in pregnant women with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphospholipid_antibodies" title="Antiphospholipid antibodies">antiphospholipid antibodies</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indomethacin" title="Indomethacin">indomethacin</a> is used in pregnancy to treat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhydramnios" title="Polyhydramnios">polyhydramnios</a> by reducing fetal urine production via inhibiting  fetal kidney blood flow. In contrast, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol" title="Paracetamol">paracetamol</a> (acetaminophen) is regarded as being safe  and well-tolerated during pregnancy, but Leffers et al. released a study in  2010 indicating that there may be associated male infertility in the  unborn. Doses should be taken as prescribed, due to risk of liver toxicity  with overdoses. In France, the country's health agency contraindicates the use  of NSAIDs, including aspirin, after the sixth month of pregnancy.</p>
   
   <h3>Allergy/allergy-like  hypersensitivity reactions</h3>
   <p>A variety of  allergic or allergic-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAID_hypersensitivity_reactions" title="NSAID hypersensitivity reactions">NSAID hypersensitivity reactions</a> follow the ingestion of NSAIDs. These hypersensitivity reactions  differ from the other adverse reactions listed here which are toxicity  reactions, i.e. unwanted reactions that result from the pharmacological action  of a drug, are dose-related, and can occur in any treated individual;  hypersensitivity reactions are idiosyncratic reactions to a drug. Some  NSAID hypersensitivity reactions are truly allergic in origin: <strong>1)</strong> repetitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgE" title="IgE">IgE</a>-mediated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticarial" title="Urticarial">urticarial</a> skin eruptions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioedema" title="Angioedema">angioedema</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis" title="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</a> following immediately to hours after  ingesting one structural type of NSAID but not after ingesting structurally  unrelated NSAIDs; and <strong>2)</strong> Comparatively mild to moderately  severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell" title="T cell">T cell</a>-mediated delayed onset (usually more than 24  hour), skin reactions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maculopapular_rash" title="Maculopapular rash">maculopapular  rash</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_drug_eruption" title="Fixed drug eruption">fixed  drug eruptions</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitivity_reaction" title="Photosensitivity reaction">photosensitivity  reactions</a>, delayed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria" title="Urticaria">urticaria</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis" title="Contact dermatitis">contact  dermatitis</a>; or <strong>3)</strong> far  more severe and potentially life-threatening t-cell-mediated delayed systemic  reactions such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRESS_syndrome" title="DRESS syndrome">DRESS syndrome</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_generalized_exanthematous_pustulosis" title="Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis">acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%E2%80%93Johnson_syndrome" title="Stevens–Johnson syndrome">Stevens–Johnson  syndrome</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_epidermal_necrolysis" title="Toxic epidermal necrolysis">toxic  epidermal necrolysis</a>.  Other NSAID hypersensitivity reactions are allergy-like symptoms but do not  involve true allergic mechanisms; rather, they appear due to the ability of  NSAIDs to alter the metabolism of arachidonic acid in favor of forming  metabolites that promote allergic symptoms. Afflicted individuals may be  abnormally sensitive to these provocative metabolites or overproduce them and  typically are susceptible to a wide range of structurally dissimilar NSAIDs,  particularly those that inhibit COX1. Symptoms, which develop immediately to  hours after ingesting any of various NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1, are: <strong>1)</strong> exacerbations  of asthmatic and rhinitis (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin-induced_asthma" title="Aspirin-induced asthma">aspirin-induced  asthma</a>) symptoms in  individuals with a history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma" title="Asthma">asthma</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis" title="Rhinitis">rhinitis</a> and <strong>2)</strong> exacerbation  or first-time development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheals" title="Wheals">wheals</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioedema" title="Angioedema">angioedema</a> in individuals with or without a  history of chronic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticarial" title="Urticarial">urticarial</a> lesions or angioedema.</p>
   
   <h3>Other</h3>
   <p>Common adverse  drug reactions (ADR), other than listed above, include: raised liver <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzymes" title="Enzymes">enzymes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache" title="Headache">headache</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness" title="Dizziness">dizziness</a>. Uncommon ADRs include an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperkalaemia" title="Hyperkalaemia">abnormally high level of potassium in the  blood</a>, confusion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchospasm" title="Bronchospasm">spasm of the airways</a>, and rash. Ibuprofen may also rarely  cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome" title="Irritable bowel syndrome">irritable  bowel syndrome</a> symptoms.  NSAIDs are also implicated in some cases of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%E2%80%93Johnson_syndrome" title="Stevens–Johnson syndrome">Stevens–Johnson  syndrome</a>. Most NSAIDs  penetrate poorly into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system" title="Central nervous system">central  nervous system</a> (CNS).  However, the COX enzymes are expressed constitutively in some areas of the CNS,  meaning that even limited penetration may cause adverse effects such as  somnolence and dizziness. In very rare cases, ibuprofen can cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aseptic_meningitis" title="Aseptic meningitis">aseptic  meningitis</a>. As with other  drugs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy" title="Allergy">allergies</a> to NSAIDs might exist. While many  allergies are specific to one NSAID, up to 1 in 5 people may have unpredictable  cross-reactive allergic responses to other NSAIDs as well.</p>
   
   <h3>Drug  interactions</h3>
   <p>NSAIDs reduce  kidney blood flow and thereby decrease the efficacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic" title="Diuretic">diuretics</a>, and inhibit the elimination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_pharmacology" title="Lithium pharmacology">lithium</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate" title="Methotrexate">methotrexate</a>. NSAIDs cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocoagulability" title="Hypocoagulability">decreased ability to form a blood clot</a>, which can increase the risk of bleeding  when combined with other drugs that also decrease blood clotting, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warfarin" title="Warfarin">warfarin</a>. NSAIDs may aggravate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension" title="Hypertension">hypertension</a> (high blood pressure) and thereby antagonize  the effect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensives" title="Antihypertensives">antihypertensives</a>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor" title="ACE inhibitor">ACE inhibitors</a>. NSAIDs may interfere and reduce efficiency  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI" title="SSRI">SSRI</a> antidepressants. Various widely used  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) enhance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid" title="Endocannabinoid">endocannabinoid</a> signaling by blocking the  anandamide-degrading membrane enzyme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_amide_hydrolase" title="Fatty acid amide hydrolase">fatty  acid amide hydrolase</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAAH" title="FAAH">FAAH</a>).</p>
   
   <h3>Mechanism of  action</h3>
   <p>Most NSAIDs act  as nonselective inhibitors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase" title="Cyclooxygenase">cyclooxygenase</a> (COX), inhibiting both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase-1" title="Cyclooxygenase-1">cyclooxygenase-1</a> (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoenzyme" title="Isoenzyme">isoenzymes</a>. This inhibition is competitively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_inhibition#Reversible_inhibitors" title="Reversible inhibition">reversible</a> (albeit at varying degrees of  reversibility), as opposed to the mechanism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin" title="Aspirin">aspirin</a>, which is irreversible inhibition. COX catalyzes the formation  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin" title="Prostaglandin">prostaglandins</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboxane" title="Thromboxane">thromboxane</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid" title="Arachidonic acid">arachidonic acid</a> (itself derived from the cellular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipid" title="Phospholipid">phospholipid</a> bilayer by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_A2" title="Phospholipase A2">phospholipase A2</a>). Prostaglandins act (among other things)  as messenger molecules in the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation" title="Inflammation">inflammation</a>. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action" title="Mechanism of action">mechanism  of action</a> was  elucidated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vane" title="John Vane">John Vane</a> (1927–2004), who received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> for his work (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action_of_aspirin" title="Mechanism of action of aspirin">Mechanism of action of aspirin</a>). COX-1 is a  constitutively expressed enzyme with a &quot;house-keeping&quot; role in  regulating many normal physiological processes. One of these is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach" title="Stomach">stomach</a> lining, where prostaglandins serve a protective role, preventing the  stomach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucosa" title="Mucosa">mucosa</a> from being eroded by its own acid.  COX-2 is an enzyme facultatively expressed in inflammation, and it is  inhibition of COX-2 that produces the desirable effects of NSAIDs. When  nonselective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen)  lower stomach prostaglandin levels, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer" title="Peptic ulcer">ulcers</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach" title="Stomach">stomach</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum" title="Duodenum">duodenum</a> internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding" title="Bleeding">bleeding</a> can result. NSAIDs have been studied in various assays to understand  how they affect each of these enzymes. While the assays reveal differences,  unfortunately, different assays provide differing ratios. The discovery of  COX-2 led to research to the development of selective COX-2 inhibiting drugs  that do not cause gastric problems characteristic of older NSAIDs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol" title="Paracetamol">Paracetamol</a> (acetaminophen) is not considered an NSAID  because it has little anti-inflammatory activity. It treats pain mainly by  blocking COX-2 mostly in the central nervous system, but not much in the rest  of the body. However, many aspects of the mechanism of action of NSAIDs remain  unexplained, and for this reason, further COX pathways are hypothesized.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX-3" title="COX-3">COX-3</a> pathway was believed to fill some of this  gap but recent findings make it appear unlikely that it plays any significant  role in humans and alternative explanation models are proposed. NSAIDs interact  with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system" title="Endocannabinoid system">endocannabinoid  system</a> and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoids" title="Endocannabinoids">endocannabinoids</a>, as COX2 have been shown to utilize  endocannabinoids as substrates, and may have a key role in both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect" title="Therapeutic effect">therapeutic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect" title="Adverse effect">adverse</a> effects of NSAIDs, as well as in  NSAIDs-induced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo" title="Placebo">placebo</a>responses. NSAIDs are also used in the acute pain  caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout" title="Gout">gout</a> because they inhibit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urate" title="Urate">urate</a> crystal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis" title="Phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a> besides inhibition of prostaglandin  synthase.</p>
   
   <h3>Antipyretic  activity</h3>
   <p>NSAIDS have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipyretic" title="Antipyretic">antipyretic</a> activity and can be used to treat  fever. Fever is caused by elevated levels of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2" title="Prostaglandin E2">prostaglandin E2</a>, which alters the firing rate of neurons within  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus" title="Hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a> that control  thermoregulation. Antipyretics work by inhibiting the enzyme COX, which  causes the general inhibition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostanoid" title="Prostanoid">prostanoid</a> biosynthesis  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGE2" title="PGE2">PGE2</a>) within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus" title="Hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a>. PGE2 signals to the hypothalamus to  increase the body's thermal set point. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen" title="Ibuprofen">Ibuprofen</a> has been shown more effective as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipyretic" title="Antipyretic">antipyretic</a> than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol" title="Paracetamol">paracetamol</a>(acetaminophen). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid" title="Arachidonic acid">Arachidonic acid</a> is the precursor substrate for cyclooxygenase  leading to the production of prostaglandins F, D &amp; E.</p>
   <h3>Classification</h3>
   <p>NSAIDs can be classified  based on their chemical structure or mechanism of action. Older NSAIDs were  known long before their mechanism of action was elucidated and were for this  reason classified by chemical structure or origin. Newer substances are more  often classified by mechanism of action.</p>

   </ul>
   
   <h4>Chirality</h4>
   <p>Most NSAIDs  are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)" title="Chirality (chemistry)">chiral</a> molecules (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac" title="Diclofenac">diclofenac</a> is a notable exception). However, the  majority are prepared in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racemic" title="Racemic">racemic</a> mixture. Typically, only a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiomer" title="Enantiomer">enantiomer</a> is pharmacologically active. For some drugs  (typically profens), an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomerase" title="Isomerase">isomerase</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a> <em>in vivo</em> converts the inactive enantiomer into the active  form, although its activity varies widely in individuals. This phenomenon is  likely responsible for the poor correlation between NSAID efficacy and plasma  concentration observed in older studies, when specific analysis of the active  enantiomer was not performed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen" title="Ibuprofen">Ibuprofen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoprofen" title="Ketoprofen">ketoprofen</a> are now available in single, active  enantiomer preparations (dexibuprofen and dexketoprofen), which purport to  offer quicker onset and an improved side-effect profile. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen" title="Naproxen">Naproxen</a> has always been marketed as the single active enantiomer.</p>
   
   <h3>Main practical  differences</h3>
   <p>NSAIDs within a  group tend to have similar characteristics and tolerability. There is little  difference in clinical efficacy among the NSAIDs when used at equivalent  doses. Rather, differences among compounds usually relate to dosing  regimens (related to the compound's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_half-life" title="Elimination half-life">elimination  half-life</a>), route of  administration, and tolerability profile. Regarding adverse effects,  selective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX-2_inhibitor" title="COX-2 inhibitor">COX-2  inhibitors</a> have  lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is no significant increase  in risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">myocardial  infarction</a>. With the  exception of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen" title="Naproxen">naproxen</a>, nonselective NSAIDs increase the risk of  having a heart attack. Some data also supports that the partially  selective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabumetone" title="Nabumetone">nabumetone</a> is less likely to cause gastrointestinal  events. A consumer report noted that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen" title="Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a>, naproxen, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsalate" title="Salsalate">salsalate</a> are  less expensive than other NSAIDs, and essentially as effective and safe when  used appropriately to treat osteoarthritis and pain.</p>
   
   <h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3>
   <p>Most nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs are weak acids, with a pKa of 3–5. They are absorbed  well from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach" title="Stomach">stomach</a> and intestinal mucosa. They are  highly protein-bound in plasma (typically &gt;95%), usually to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_serum_albumin" title="Human serum albumin">albumin</a>, so that their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_distribution" title="Volume of distribution">volume  of distribution</a> typically  approximates to plasma volume. Most NSAIDs are metabolized in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a> by oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites that typically  are excreted in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine" title="Urine">urine</a>, though some drugs are partially excreted  in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile" title="Bile">bile</a>. Metabolism may be abnormal in certain disease  states, and accumulation may occur even with normal dosage. Ibuprofen and diclofenac  have short half-lives (2–3 hours). Some NSAIDs (typically oxicams) have very  long half-lives (e.g. 20–60 hours).</p>

From the era of  Greek medicine to the mid-19th century, the discovery of medicinal agents was  classed as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence" title="Empirical evidence">empirical</a> art; folklore and mythological  guidance were combined in deploying the vegetable and mineral products that  made up the expansive pharmacopeia of the time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtus" title="Myrtus">Myrtle</a> leaves were in use by 1500 BCE. Hippocrates (460–377 BCE) first  reported using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow" title="Willow">willow</a> bark and in 30 BCE <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsus" title="Celsus">Celsus</a> described  the signs of inflammation and also used willow bark to mitigate them. On 25  April 1763, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Stone_(clergyman)" title="Edward Stone (clergyman)">Edward  Stone</a> wrote to  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> describing his observations on the  use of willow bark-based medicines in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever" title="Fever">febrile</a> patients. The active ingredient of willow bark, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside" title="Glycoside">glycoside</a> called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicin" title="Salicin">salicin</a>, was  first isolated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Andreas_Buchner" title="Johann Andreas Buchner">Johann  Andreas Buchner</a> in  1827. By 1829, French chemist Henri Leroux had improved the extraction process  to obtain about 30g of purified salicin from 1.5 kg of bark. By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis" title="Hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a>, salicin releases <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> and salicylic alcohol which can be converted into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid" title="Salicylic acid">salicylic acid</a>, both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo" title="In vivo">in vivo</a> and through chemical methods. The acid is more effective than  salicin and, in addition to its fever-reducing properties, is anti-inflammatory  and analgesic. In 1869, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Kolbe" title="Hermann Kolbe">Hermann Kolbe</a> synthesised salicylate, although it was too  acidic for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa" title="Gastric mucosa">gastric mucosa</a>.] The reaction used to  synthesise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_hydrocarbon" title="Aromatic hydrocarbon">aromatic</a> acid from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol" title="Phenol">phenol</a> in the presence of CO2 is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolbe-Schmitt_reaction" title="Kolbe-Schmitt reaction">Kolbe-Schmitt  reaction</a>. By 1897 the  German chemist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Hoffmann" title="Felix Hoffmann">Felix Hoffmann</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer" title="Bayer">Bayer</a> company prompted a new age of pharmacology by converting salicylic  acid into acetylsalicylic acid—named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin" title="Aspirin">aspirin</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Dreser" title="Heinrich Dreser">Heinrich  Dreser</a>. Other NSAIDs were  developed from the 1950s forward. In 2001, NSAIDs accounted for 70,000,000  prescriptions and 30 billion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug" title="Over-the-counter drug">over-the-counter</a> doses sold annually in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
   
   <h2>COX-2 inhibitor</h2>
   <div class="mytext">
   <p><strong>Selective  COX-2 inhibitors</strong> are  a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug" title="Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</a> (NSAID) that directly targets  cyclooxygenase-2, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX-2" title="COX-2">COX-2</a>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a> responsible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation" title="Inflammation">inflammation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain" title="Pain">pain</a>. Targeting selectivity for COX-2 reduces the risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer" title="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulceration</a>, and is the main feature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celecoxib" title="Celecoxib">celecoxib</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rofecoxib" title="Rofecoxib">rofecoxib</a> and  other members of this drug class. After several COX-2 inhibiting drugs were  approved for marketing, data from clinical trials revealed that COX-2  inhibitors caused a significant increase in heart attacks and strokes, with  some drugs in the class having worse risks than others. Rofecoxib (commonly  known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vioxx" title="Vioxx">Vioxx</a>) was taken off the market in 2004 because of  these concerns and celecoxib and traditional NSAIDs received <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxed_warning" title="Boxed warning">boxed warnings</a> on their labels. Many COX-2-specific inhibitors  have been removed from the U.S. market. As of December 2011, only Celebrex  (generic name is celecoxib) is still available for purchase in the United  States.</p>

   <h3>Cancer </h3>
   <p>COX-2 appears to  be related to cancers and abnormal growths in the intestinal tract. COX  inhibitors have been shown to reduce the occurrence of cancers and  pre-cancerous growths. The National Cancer Institute has done some studies on  COX-2 and cancer. The FDA has approved Celebrex for treatment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_adenomatous_polyposis" title="Familial adenomatous polyposis">familial adenomatous polyposis</a> (FAP). COX-2 inhibitors are currently being studied in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a> and appear to be beneficial.</p>
   
   <h3>Neuropsychiatric  disorders</h3> 
   <p>COX-2 inhibitors  have been found to be effective in suppressing inflammatory neurodegenerative  pathways in mental illness, with beneficial results in trials for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder" title="Major depressive disorder">major  depressive disorder</a> as  well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>.</p>
  
   <h3>Other targets</h3>
   <p>The inhibition of  COX-2 is paramount for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory" title="Anti-inflammatory">anti-inflammatory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic" title="Analgesic">analgesic</a> function of the selective COX-2 inhibitor  celecoxib. However, with regard to this drug&rsquo;s promise for the therapy of  advanced cancers, it is unclear whether the inhibition of COX-2 plays a  dominant role, and this has become a controversial and intensely researched  issue. In recent years, several additional intracellular components (besides  COX-2) were discovered that appear to be important for mediating the anticancer  effects of celecoxib in the absence of COX-2. Moreover, a recent study  with various malignant tumor cells showed that celecoxib could inhibit the  growth of these cells, even though some of these cancer cells didn&rsquo;t even  contain COX-2. Additional support for the idea that other targets besides COX-2  are important for celecoxib&rsquo;s anticancer effects has come from studies with chemically  modified versions of celecoxib. Several dozen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_(chemistry)" title="Analog (chemistry)">analogs</a> of celecoxib were generated with  small alterations in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure" title="Chemical structure">chemical  structures</a>. Some of  these analogs retained COX-2 inhibitory activity, whereas many others didn&rsquo;t.  However, when the ability of all these compounds to kill tumor cells in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture" title="Cell culture">cell culture</a> was investigated, it turned out that the  antitumor potency did not at all depend on whether or not the respective  compound could inhibit COX-2, showing that inhibition of COX-2 was not required  for the anticancer effects. One of these compounds,  2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib, which entirely lacks the ability to inhibit COX-2,  actually turned out to display stronger anticancer activity than celecoxib  itself and this anticancer effect could also be verified in highly  drug-resistant tumor cells and in various animal tumor models.</p>
   
   <h3>Adverse  effects</h3>
   <p>Analysis of  clinical trial data revealed that there was a significant increase in the rate  of vascular events with COX-2 inhibitors compared with placebo; &quot;vascular  events&quot; are non-fatal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">myocardial  infarction</a> (MI) or  heart attack, non-fatal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke" title="Stroke">stroke</a>, and death from a vascular event such as MI or stroke. These results  led Merck to voluntarily withdraw (Rofecoxib) from the market in September 2004  and to regulatory authorities imposing a boxed warning on the label of  celecoxib.[ Traditional NSAIDs were also found to have  cardiovascular risks, leading to similar boxed warnings. The cause of the  cardiovascular problems became, and remains, a subject of intensive  research. As of 2012 results have been converging on the hypothesis that  the adverse cardiovascular effects are most likely due to inhibition of COX-2  in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessels" title="Blood vessels">blood vessels</a>, which leads to a decrease in the  production of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostacyclin" title="Prostacyclin">prostacyclin</a> in them. Prostacyclin usually  prevents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_aggregation" title="Platelet aggregation">platelet  aggregation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction" title="Vasoconstriction">vasoconstriction</a>, so its inhibition can lead to excess clot  formation and higher blood pressure.</p>
   
   <h3>Research  history</h3>
   <p>The COX-2 enzyme  was discovered in 1988 by Daniel Simmons, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University" title="Brigham Young University">Brigham  Young University</a> researcher. The  mouse COX-2 gene was cloned by UCLA scientist Dr. Harvey Herschman, a finding  published in 1991. The basic research leading to the discovery of COX-2  inhibitors has been the subject of at least two lawsuits. Brigham Young  University has sued Pfizer, alleging breach of contract from relations BYU had  with the company at the time of Dr. Simmons work. A settlement was reached  in April 2012 in which Pfizer agreed to pay $450 million. The other  litigation is based on United States Pat. No. 6,048,850 owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Rochester" title="University of Rochester">University  of Rochester</a>, which  claimed a method to treat pain without causing gastro-intestinal distress by  selectively inhibiting COX-2. When the patent issued, the university sued  Searle (later Pfizer) in a case called, <em>University of Rochester v. G.D.  Searle &amp; Co.</em>, 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court ruled in favor  of Searle in 2004, holding in essence that the university had claimed a method  requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could  inhibit COX-2 and therefore the patent was invalid. In the course of the search  for a specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor" title="Enzyme inhibitor">inhibitor</a> of the negative effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin" title="Prostaglandin">prostaglandins</a> which spared the positive effects, it was  discovered that prostaglandins could indeed be separated into two general  classes which could loosely be regarded as &quot;good prostaglandins&quot; and  &quot;bad prostaglandins&quot;, according to the structure of a  particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a> involved in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis" title="Biosynthesis">biosynthesis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase" title="Cyclooxygenase">cyclooxygenase</a>. Prostaglandins whose synthesis involves  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase" title="Cyclooxygenase">cyclooxygenase-I</a> enzyme, or COX-1, are responsible  for maintenance and protection of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract" title="Gastrointestinal tract">gastrointestinal  tract</a>, while  prostaglandins whose synthesis involves the cyclooxygenase-II enzyme, or COX-2,  are responsible for inflammation and pain. The existing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAID" title="NSAID">NSAIDs</a>) differ in their relative specificities for COX-2  and COX-1; while aspirin and ibuprofen inhibit COX-2 and COX-1 enzymes, other  NSAIDs appear to have partial COX-2 specificity, particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meloxicam" title="Meloxicam">meloxicam</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobic" title="Mobic">Mobic</a>). Aspirin is ≈170-fold more potent in inhibiting COX-1 than  COX-2. Studies of meloxicam 7.5 mg per day for 23 days find a level  of gastric injury similar to that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo" title="Placebo">placebo</a>, and for meloxicam 15 mg per day a level of injury lower than that of  other NSAIDs; however, in clinical practice meloxicam can still cause  some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer" title="Peptic ulcer">ulcer</a> complications. Valdecoxib and  rofecoxib were about 300 times more potent at inhibiting COX-2 than COX-1, but  too toxic for the heart, suggesting the possibility of relief from pain and  inflammation without gastrointestinal irritation, and promising to be a boon  for those who had previously experienced adverse effects or had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity" title="Comorbidity">comorbidities</a> that could lead to such complications.  Celecoxib is approximately 30 times more potent at inhibiting COX-2 than COX-1,  with etoricoxib being 106 times more potent. Also, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribulus_terrestris" title="Tribulus terrestris">Tribulus terrestris</a> was shown to have  strong inhibitory activity on COX-2.</p>
   
   <h3>Research fraud</h3>
   <p>Between 1996 and  2009, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiology" title="Anesthesiology">anesthesiologist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Reuben" title="Scott Reuben">Scott Reuben</a> conducted clinical research on the use of  COX-2 inhibitors, often in combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin" title="Gabapentin">gabapentin</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregabalin" title="Pregabalin">pregabalin</a>, for the prevention and treatment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Post-surgical_pain&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Post-surgical pain (page does not exist)">post-surgical pain</a>, research which was found in 2009 to have been  faked. Reuben pleaded guilty, paid fines and served six months in jail, and  lost his medical license. A 2009 review of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review" title="Systematic review">meta-articles</a> used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine" title="Evidence-based medicine">evidence-based  medicine</a> found that  while some reviews were no longer valid when the Reuben studies were removed,  the conclusions in the majority of them remained unchanged. The review  found that the key Reuben claims that needed to be re-examined were &quot;the  absence of detrimental effects of coxibs on bone healing after spine surgery,  the beneficial long-term outcome after preemptive administration of coxibs  including an allegedly decreased incidence of chronic pain after surgery, and  the analgesic efficacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketorolac" title="Ketorolac">ketorolac</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonidine" title="Clonidine">clonidine</a> when added to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetics" title="Local anesthetics">local anesthetics</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_regional_anesthesia" title="Intravenous regional anesthesia">intravenous regional anesthesia</a>.&quot;</p>
   
   <h3>Early  COX-2-inhibiting drugs</h3>
   <p>Celebrex (and  other brand names for celecoxib) was introduced in 1999 and rapidly became the  most frequently prescribed new drug in the United States. By October 2000, its  US sales exceeded 100 million prescriptions per year for $3 billion, and was  still rising. Sales of Celebrex alone reached $3.1 billion in 2001. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spanish</a> study found that between January 2000 and June 2001, 7% of NSAID  prescriptions and 29% of NSAID expenditures were for COX-2 inhibitors. Over the  period of the study, COX-2 inhibitors rose from 10.03% of total NSAIDs  prescribed by specialty physicians to 29.79%, and from 1.52% to 10.78% of  NSAIDs prescribed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician" title="Primary care physician">primary  care physicians</a> (98.23%  of NSAIDs and 94.61% of COX-2 inhibitors were prescribed by primary care  physicians). For specialty physicians, rofecoxib and celecoxib were third and  fifth most frequently prescribed NSAIDs but first and second in cost,  respectively; for primary-care physicians they were ninth and twelfth most  frequently prescribed NSAIDs and first and fourth in cost. The cause of the  rapid widespread acceptance of Celebrex and Vioxx by physicians was the  publication of two large trials, the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study  (CLASS) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_(journal)" title="JAMA (journal)">JAMA</a>, and the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research  (VIGOR). The VIGOR trial was later proven to have been based on faulty  data, and Vioxx was eventually withdrawn from the market.</p>
   
   <h3>VIGOR study  and publishing controversy</h3>
   <p>The VIGOR (Vioxx  Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research) trial, &quot;which was the making of  Merck's drug rofecoxib (Vioxx),&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX-2_inhibitor#cite_note-Smith_2006-38">]</a>was at the center of a dispute about the ethics of  medical journals. VIGOR trial,1 was a trial in which over 8000 patients were  randomized to receive either naproxen or rofecoxib (Vioxx), a Cox-2 inhibitor  that Merck hoped would have fewer gastrointestinal side effects.&quot;  Both  publications concluded that COX-2 specific NSAIDs were associated with  significantly fewer adverse gastrointestinal effects. In the CLASS trial  comparing Celebrex 800 mg/day to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen" title="Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a> 2400 mg/day and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac" title="Diclofenac">diclofenac</a> 150 mg/day for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis" title="Osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis" title="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid  arthritis</a> for six  months, Celebrex was associated with significantly fewer upper gastrointestinal  complications (0.44% vs. 1.27%, P=0.04), with no significant difference in  incidence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular" title="Cardiovascular">cardiovascular</a> events in patients not taking  aspirin for cardiovascular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis" title="Prophylaxis">prophylaxis</a>. The VIGOR trial results were published in 2000  in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> Bombardier and his  research team claimed that there was &quot;an increase in myocardial infarction  in the patients given rofecoxib (0.4%) compared with those given naproxen  (0.1%)&quot; and &quot;patients given naproxen experienced 121 side effects  compared with 56 in the patients taking rofecoxib,&quot; a &quot;marvellous  result for Merck&quot; which &quot;contributed to huge sales of  rofecoxib.&quot; Merck's scientists incorrectly interpreted the finding as  a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart  attacks &quot;is primarily due to&quot; this protective effect. In  September 2001, the United States <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="Food and Drug Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, &quot;Your  promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on  Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial  infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen).&quot; This led  to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning  the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke). By  2005 <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em> published an  editorial accusing the Bombardier et al. of deliberately withholding data. Dr.  Claire Bombardier, a University of Toronto rheumatologist, had claimed that the  VIGOR trial testing resulted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vioxx" title="Vioxx">Vioxx</a> 50 mg/day versus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen" title="Naproxen">naproxen</a> for rheumatoid arthritis, Vioxx reduced the risk of symptomatic  ulcers and clinical upper gastrointestinal events (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation" title="Gastrointestinal perforation">perforations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_outlet_obstruction" title="Gastric outlet obstruction">obstructions</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_gastrointestinal_bleeding" title="Upper gastrointestinal bleeding">bleeding</a>) by 54%, to  1.4% from 3%, the risk of complicated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Upper_gastrointestinal_event&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Upper gastrointestinal event (page does not exist)">upper gastrointestinal events</a> (complicated perforations,  obstructions and bleeding in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_gastrointestinal_tract" title="Upper gastrointestinal tract">upper gastrointestinal tract</a>) by 57%, and the risk of bleeding from anywhere in the gastrointestinal  tract by 62%. An enormous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing" title="Marketing">marketing</a> effort capitalized on these publications;  Vioxx was the most heavily advertised prescription drug in 2000, and Celebrex  the seventh, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMS_Health" title="IMS Health">IMS Health</a>.</p>
   
   <h3>Neuroblastomas</h3>
   <p>Small tumors of  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system" title="Sympathetic nervous system">sympathetic  nervous system</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma" title="Neuroblastoma">neuroblastoma</a>) appear to have abnormal levels of COX-2  expressed. These studies report that overexpression of the COX-2 enzyme  has an adverse effect on the tumor suppressor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53" title="P53">p53</a>. p53 is an apoptosis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor" title="Transcription factor">transcription  factor</a> normally  found in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol" title="Cytosol">cytosol</a>. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cellular_DNA&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Cellular DNA (page does not exist)">cellular DNA</a> is  damaged beyond repair, p53 is transported to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus" title="Cell nucleus">nucleus</a> where it promotes p53 mediated apoptosis.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX-2_inhibitor#cite_note-Lau_2007-44">[44]</a> Two of the metabolites of COX-2, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prostaglandin_A2&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Prostaglandin A2 (page does not exist)">prostaglandin A2</a> (PGA2)  and A1 (PGA1), when present in high quantities bind to p53 in the cytosol and  inhibit its ability to cross into the nucleus. This essentially sequesters p53  in the cytosol and prevents apoptosis. Coxibs such as Celebrex  (celecoxib), by selectively inhibiting the overexpressed COX-2, allow p53 to  work properly. Functional p53 allows DNA damaged neuroblastoma cells to  commit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a> through apoptosis, halting tumor  growth. COX-2 up-regulation has also been linked to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation" title="Phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> and activation of the E3 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin_ligase" title="Ubiquitin ligase">ubiquitin ligase</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HDM2&action=edit&redlink=1" title="HDM2 (page does not exist)">HDM2</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> that mediates p53 ligation and tagged destruction, through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitination" title="Ubiquitination">ubiquitination</a>. The mechanism for this neuroblastoma HDM2  hyperactivity is unknown. Studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors block the  phosphorylation of HDM2 preventing its activation. In vitro, the use of COX-2  inhibitors lowers the level of active HDM2 found in neuroblastoma cells. The  exact process of how COX-2 inhibitors block HDM2 phosphorylation is unknown,  but this mediated reduction in active HDM2 concentration level restores the  cellular p53 levels. After treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor, the restored p53  function allows DNA damaged neuroblastoma cells to commit suicide through  apoptosis reducing the size of growth of the tumor.</p>
