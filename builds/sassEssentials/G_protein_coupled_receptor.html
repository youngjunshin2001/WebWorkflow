    <h1>G-protein–coupled receptor</h1>
      <p>G-protein–coupled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor" title="Cell surface receptor">receptors</a> (GPCRs) which are also known as seven-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical  receptors, serpentine receptor,  and G protein–linked receptors (GPLR), constitute a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_receptor" title="Membrane receptor">receptors</a>, that detect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecules</a> outside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)" title="Cell (biology)">cell</a> and activate internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction" title="Signal transduction">signal transduction</a> pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses. Coupling with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein" title="G protein">G proteins</a>, they are called seven-transmembrane  receptors because they pass through the cell membrane seven times. G  protein–coupled receptors are found only in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote" title="Eukaryote">eukaryotes</a>, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast" title="Yeast">yeast</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choanoflagellate" title="Choanoflagellate">choanoflagellates</a>, and  animals. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)" title="Ligand (biochemistry)">ligands</a> that  bind and activate these receptors include light-sensitive compounds, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor" title="Odor">odors</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone" title="Pheromone">pheromones</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone" title="Hormone">hormones</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter" title="Neurotransmitter">neurotransmitters</a>, and vary in size from small  molecules to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide" title="Peptide">peptides</a> to large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a>. G protein–coupled receptors are  involved in many diseases, and are also the target of approximately 40% of all  modern medicinal drugs.<p>There are two  principal signal transduction pathways involving the G protein–coupled  receptors:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
      <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate" title="Cyclic adenosine monophosphate">cAMP</a> signal pathway and</li>
      <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol" title="Phosphatidylinositol">phosphatidylinositol</a> signal pathway. When a ligand binds to the GPCR it causes a conformational       change in the GPCR, which allows it to act as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine_nucleotide_exchange_factor" title="Guanine nucleotide exchange factor">guanine       nucleotide exchange factor</a> (GEF). The GPCR can then activate an       associated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein" title="G protein">G protein</a> by       exchanging the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_diphosphate" title="Guanosine diphosphate">GDP</a> bound to the G protein for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_triphosphate" title="Guanosine triphosphate">GTP</a>.       The G protein's α subunit, together with the bound GTP, can then       dissociate from the β and γ subunits to further affect intracellular       signaling proteins or target functional proteins directly depending on the       α subunit type (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%CE%B1s" title="Gαs">Gαs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%CE%B1i" title="Gαi">Gαi/o</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%CE%B1q" title="Gαq">Gαq/11</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G12/G13_alpha_subunits" title="G12/G13 alpha subunits">Gα12/13</a>).</li></ul></p>

As of 2012, two of the top ten global best-selling  drugs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluticasone/salmeterol" title="Fluticasone/salmeterol">Advair Diskus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilify" title="Abilify">Abilify</a>) act by targeting G protein–coupled  receptors.</p>
      
      <h2>2.0 Classification</h2>
      <p>Classification  Scheme of GPCRs. Class A (Rhodopsin-like), Class B (Secretin-like),Class C  (Glutamate Receptor-like), Others (Adhesion (33), Frizzled (11), Taste type-2  (25), unclassified (23)).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein%E2%80%93coupled_receptor#cite_note-pmid16753280-10">[10]</a> The exact size  of the GPCR superfamily is unknown, but nearly 800 different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" title="Human">human</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genes" title="Genes">genes</a> (or ~ 4% of the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis" title="Protein biosynthesis">protein-coding</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>) have been predicted to code for them from  genome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis" title="Sequence analysis">sequence analysis</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein%E2%80%93coupled_receptor#cite_note-pmid16753280-10">[10]</a> Although numerous classification  schemes have been proposed, the superfamily was classically divided into three  main classes (A, B and C) with no detectable shared <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_homology" title="Sequence homology">sequence homology</a> between classes. The largest  class by far is class A, which accounts for nearly 85% of the GPCR genes. Of  class A GPCRs, over half of these are predicted to encode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_receptors" title="Olfactory receptors">olfactory receptors</a>,  while the remaining receptors are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)" title="Ligand (biochemistry)">liganded</a> by  known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous" title="Endogenous">endogenous</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound" title="Chemical compound">compounds</a> or are classified as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_receptor" title="Orphan receptor">orphan receptors</a>. Despite the lack of sequence  homology between classes, all GPCRs have a common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_tertiary_structure" title="Protein tertiary structure">structure</a> and mechanism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction" title="Signal transduction">signal transduction</a>.  The very large rhodopsin A group has been further subdivided into 19 subgroups  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin-like_receptors#Classes" title="Rhodopsin-like receptors">A1-A19</a>).</p>
      <p>More recently,  an alternative classification system called GRAFS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor" title="Metabotropic glutamate receptor">Glutamate</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin" title="Rhodopsin">Rhodopsin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion-GPCRs" title="Adhesion-GPCRs"><em>Adhesion</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frizzled" title="Frizzled">Frizzled</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_receptor" title="Taste receptor">Taste2</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretin_receptor" title="Secretin receptor">Secretin</a>) has been proposed. According to the  classical A-F system, GPCRs can be grouped into 6 classes based on sequence  homology and functional similarity: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Class A       (or 1) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin-like_receptors" title="Rhodopsin-like receptors">Rhodopsin-like</a>)</li>
        <li>Class B       (or 2) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretin_receptor_family" title="Secretin receptor family">Secretin       receptor family</a>)</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_C_GPCR" title="Class C GPCR">Class C</a> (or 3) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor" title="Metabotropic glutamate receptor">Metabotropic       glutamate</a>/pheromone)</li>
        <li>Class D       (or 4) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungal_mating_pheromone_receptors" title="Fungal mating pheromone receptors">Fungal       mating pheromone receptors</a>)</li>
        <li>Class E       (or 5) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_AMP_receptors" title="Cyclic AMP receptors">Cyclic AMP receptors</a>)</li>
        <li>Class F       (or 6) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frizzled" title="Frizzled">Frizzled</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothened" title="Smoothened">Smoothened</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An early study  based on available DNA sequence suggested that the human genome encodes roughly  750 G protein–coupled receptors, about 350 of which detect hormones, growth  factors, and other endogenous ligands. Approximately 150 of the GPCRs found in  the human genome have unknown functions.</p>
      <p>Some  web-servers and bioinformatics prediction methods have been used for predicting  the classification of GPCRs according to their amino acid sequence alone, by  means of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_amino_acid_composition" title="Pseudo amino acid composition">pseudo amino  acid composition</a> approach.</p>
      
      <h2>3.0 Physiological roles</h2>
      <p>GPCRs are  involved in a wide variety of physiological processes. Some examples of their  physiological roles include:</p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>The visual       sense: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsin" title="Opsin">opsins</a> use a photoisomerization reaction to       translate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic       radiation</a> into cellular signals. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin" title="Rhodopsin">Rhodopsin</a>, for example, uses the conversion       of <em>11-cis</em>-retinal to <em>all-trans</em>-retinal for this purpose</li>
        <li>The       gustatory sense (taste): GPCRs in taste cells mediate release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustducin" title="Gustducin">gustducin</a> in response to bitter- and       sweet-tasting substances.</li>
        <li>The sense       of smell: Receptors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_epithelium" title="Olfactory epithelium">olfactory epithelium</a> bind odorants (olfactory receptors) and pheromones (vomeronasal receptors)</li>
        <li>Behavioral       and mood regulation: Receptors in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammalian</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain" title="Brain">brain</a> bind several different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter" title="Neurotransmitter">neurotransmitters</a>,       including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin" title="Serotonin">serotonin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine" title="Dopamine">dopamine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-aminobutyric_acid" title="Gamma-aminobutyric acid">GABA</a>,       and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate" title="Glutamate">glutamate</a></li>
        <li>Regulation       of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system" title="Immune system">immune system</a> activity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation" title="Inflammation">inflammation</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine" title="Chemokine">Chemokine</a> receptors bind ligands that       mediate intercellular communication between cells of the immune system;       receptors such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine_receptors" title="Histamine receptors">histamine receptors</a> bind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_mediators" title="Inflammatory mediators">inflammatory       mediators</a> and engage target cell types in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation" title="Inflammation">inflammatory response</a>. GPCRs are also       involved in immune-modulation and directly involved in suppression of       TLR-induced immune responses from T cells. </li>
        <li>Autonomic       nervous system transmission: Both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system" title="Sympathetic nervous system">sympathetic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system" title="Parasympathetic nervous system">parasympathetic</a> nervous systems are regulated by GPCR pathways, responsible for control of       many automatic functions of the body such as blood pressure, heart rate,       and digestive processes</li>

      </ol>
      <p>GPCRs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_membrane_protein" title="Integral membrane protein">integral membrane</a>proteins that possess seven membrane-spanning domains or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_helix" title="Transmembrane helix">transmembrane helices</a>.  The extracellular parts of the receptor can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation" title="Glycosylation">glycosylated</a>. These extracellular loops also  contain two highly conserved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine" title="Cysteine">cysteine</a> residues that form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide_bond" title="Disulfide bond">disulfide bonds</a> to stabilize the receptor  structure. Some seven-transmembrane helix proteins (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channelrhodopsin" title="Channelrhodopsin">channelrhodopsin</a>) that resemble GPCRs may contain  ion channels, within their protein. Similar to  GPCRs, the adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADIPOR1" title="ADIPOR1">ADIPOR1</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADIPOR2" title="ADIPOR2">ADIPOR2</a>) also possess 7 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_domain" title="Transmembrane domain">transmembrane domains</a>.  However, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 are oriented oppositely to GPCRs in the membrane  (i.e. GPCRs usually have an extracellular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-terminus" title="N-terminus">N-terminus</a>, cytoplasmic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-terminus" title="C-terminus">C-terminus</a>, whereas ADIPORs are inverted) and do  not associate with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein" title="G protein">G proteins</a>. Early  structural models for GPCRs were based on their weak analogy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriorhodopsin" title="Bacteriorhodopsin">bacteriorhodopsin</a>, for which a structure had been  determined by both electron diffraction (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank" title="Protein Data Bank">PDB</a>: <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2BRD">2BRD</a>​, <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1AT9">1AT9</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography" title="X-ray crystallography">X ray-based  crystallography</a> (<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1AP9">1AP9</a>). In 2000, the first crystal structure of a  mammalian GPCR, that of bovine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin" title="Rhodopsin">rhodopsin</a> (<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=1F88">1F88</a>), was solved. While the main feature, the  seven-transmembrane helices, is conserved, the relative orientation of the  helices differ significantly from that of bacteriorhodopsin. In 2007, the first  structure of a human GPCR was solved (<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=2R4R">2R4R</a>, <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=2R4S">2R4S</a>). This was followed immediately by a higher  resolution structure of the same receptor (<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=2RH1">2RH1</a>). This human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-2_adrenergic_receptor" title="Beta-2 adrenergic receptor">β2-adrenergic  receptor</a> GPCR structure proved highly similar to the bovine  rhodopsin in terms of the relative orientation of the seven-transmembrane  helices. However, the conformation of the second extracellular loop is entirely  different between the two structures. Since this loop constitutes the  &quot;lid&quot; that covers the top of the ligand binding site, this  conformational difference highlights the difficulties in constructing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_modeling" title="Homology modeling">homology models</a> of other GPCRs based only on the  rhodopsin structure. The structures  of activated and/or agonist-bound GPCRs have also been determined. These structures indicate how ligand  binding at the extracellular side of a receptor leads to conformational changes  in the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. The biggest change is an outward  movement of the cytoplasmic part of the 5th and 6th transmembrane helix (TM5  and TM6). The structure of activated beta-2 adrenergic receptor in complex with  Gs confirmed that the Gα binds to a cavity created by this movement. A structure  database, <a href="http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/GPCR-HGmod">GPCR-HGmod</a>, was recently constructed which  contains 3D structural models of all human G-protein coupled receptors, built  by the GPCR-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-TASSER" title="I-TASSER">I-TASSER</a> pipeline through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_modeling" title="Homology modeling">homology modeling</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_structure_prediction" title="Ab initio structure prediction">ab initio  structure prediction</a>.</p>

      <p>Two-dimensional  schematic of a generic GPCR set in a Lipid Raft. Click the image for higher  resolution to see details regarding the locations of important structures. In terms of  structure, GPCRs are characterized by an extracellular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-terminus" title="N-terminus">N-terminus</a>, followed by seven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_domain" title="Transmembrane domain">transmembrane</a> (7-TM) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix" title="Alpha helix">α-helices</a> (TM-1 to TM-7) connected by three  intracellular (IL-1 to IL-3) and three extracellular loops (EL-1 to EL-3), and  finally an intracellular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-terminus" title="C-terminus">C-terminus</a>. The GPCR  arranges itself into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_tertiary_structure" title="Protein tertiary structure">tertiary structure</a> resembling a barrel, with the seven transmembrane helices forming a cavity within  the plasma membrane that serves a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)" title="Ligand (biochemistry)">ligand</a>-binding  domain that is often covered by EL-2. Ligands may also bind elsewhere, however,  as is the case for bulkier ligands (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a> or large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide" title="Peptide">peptides</a>), which instead interact with the  extracellular loops, or, as illustrated by the class C <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptors" title="Metabotropic glutamate receptors">metabotropic  glutamate receptors</a> (mGluRs), the N-terminal tail. The class C GPCRs  are distinguished by their large N-terminal tail, which also contains a  ligand-binding domain. Upon glutamate-binding to an mGluR, the N-terminal tail  undergoes a conformational change that leads to its interaction with the  residues of the extracellular loops and TM domains. The eventual effect of all  three types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist" title="Agonist">agonist</a>-induced activation is a change in the  relative orientations of the TM helices (likened to a twisting motion) leading  to a wider intracellular surface and &quot;revelation&quot; of residues of the  intracellular helices and TM domains crucial to signal transduction function  (i.e., G-protein coupling). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_agonists" title="Inverse agonists">Inverse agonists</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist" title="Receptor antagonist">antagonists</a> may  also bind to a number of different sites, but the eventual effect must be  prevention of this TM helix reorientation. The structure  of the N- and C-terminal tails of GPCRs may also serve important functions  beyond ligand-binding. For example, The C-terminus of M3 muscarinic  receptors is sufficient, and the six-amino-acid polybasic (KKKRRK) domain in  the C-terminus is necessary for its preassembly with Gq proteins. In  particular, the C-terminus often contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine" title="Serine">serine</a> (Ser) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine" title="Threonine">threonine</a> (Thr) residues that, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation" title="Phosphorylation">phosphorylated</a>, increase the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)" title="Affinity (pharmacology)">affinity</a> of  the intracellular surface for the binding of scaffolding proteins called β-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrestin" title="Arrestin">arrestins</a> (β-arr). Once bound, β-arrestins both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterically" title="Sterically">sterically</a> prevent G-protein coupling and may  recruit other proteins, leading to the creation of signaling complexes involved  in extracellular-signal regulated kinase (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases" title="Extracellular signal-regulated kinases">ERK</a>)  pathway activation or receptor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis" title="Endocytosis">endocytosis</a> (internalization). As the  phosphorylation of these Ser and Thr residues often occurs as a result of GPCR  activation, the β-arr-mediated G-protein-decoupling and internalization of  GPCRs are important mechanisms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desensitization_(medicine)" title="Desensitization (medicine)">desensitization</a>.  In addition, internalized &quot;mega-complexes&quot; consisting of a single  GPCR, β-arr(in the tail conformation), and heterotrimeric G protein exist and  may account for protein signaling from endosomes. A final common  structural theme among GPCRs is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitoylation" title="Palmitoylation">palmitoylation</a> of one or more sites of the  C-terminal tail or the intracellular loops. Palmitoylation is the covalent  modification of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine" title="Cysteine">cysteine</a> (Cys) residues via  addition of hydrophobic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyl" title="Acyl">acyl groups</a>, and has the effect  of targeting the receptor to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol" title="Cholesterol">cholesterol</a>- and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingolipid" title="Sphingolipid">sphingolipid</a>-rich microdomains of the plasma  membrane called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_raft" title="Lipid raft">lipid rafts</a>. As many of  the downstream transducer and effector molecules of GPCRs (including those  involved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback" title="Negative feedback">negative feedback</a> pathways) are also targeted to lipid rafts, this has the effect of facilitating  rapid receptor signaling.GPCRs respond  to extracellular signals mediated by a huge diversity of agonists, ranging from  proteins to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogenic_amines" title="Biogenic amines">biogenic amines</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protons" title="Protons">protons</a>, but all transduce this signal via a  mechanism of G-protein coupling. This is made possible by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine" title="Guanine">guanine</a>-nucleotide exchange factor (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine_nucleotide_exchange_factor" title="Guanine nucleotide exchange factor">GEF</a>)  domain primarily formed by a combination of IL-2 and IL-3 along with adjacent  residues of the associated TM helices.</p>
      
      <h2>6.0 Mechanism</h2>
      <p>Cartoon  depicting the basic concept of GPCR Conformational Activation. Ligand binding  disrupts an ionic lock between the E/DRY motif of TM-3 and acidic residues of  TM-6. As a result, the GPCR reorganizes to allow activation of G-alpha  proteins. The side perspective is a view from above and to the side of the GPCR  as it is set in the plasma membrane (the membrane lipids have been omitted for  clarity). The intracellular perspective shows the view looking up at the plasma  membrane from inside the cell. The G  protein–coupled receptor is activated by an external signal in the form of a  ligand or other signal mediator. This creates a conformational change in the  receptor, causing activation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein" title="G protein">G protein</a>. Further effect depends on the type of  G protein. G proteins are subsequently inactivated by GTPase activating  proteins, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulator_of_G_protein_signalling" title="Regulator of G protein signalling">RGS proteins</a>.</p>

However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease-activated_receptor" title="Protease-activated receptor">protease-activated  receptors</a> are activated by cleavage of part of their extracellular  domain.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein%E2%80%93coupled_receptor#cite_note-pmid12970120-45">[45]</a></p>
      
      <h3>6.2 Conformational change</h3>
      <p>Crystal  structure of activated beta-2 adrenergic receptor in complex with Gs(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank" title="Protein Data Bank">PDB</a> entry <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/cgi/explore.cgi?pdbId=3SN6">3SN6</a>). The receptor is colored red, Gα green, Gβ  cyan, and Gγ yellow. The C-terminus of Gα is located in a cavity created by an  outward movement of the cytoplasmic parts of TM5 and 6. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction" title="Signal transduction">transduction of the signal</a> through the membrane by the receptor is not completely understood. It is known  that in the inactive state, the GPCR is bound to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotrimeric_G_protein" title="Heterotrimeric G protein">heterotrimeric G  protein</a> complex. Binding of an agonist to the GPCR results in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformational_change" title="Conformational change">conformational change</a> in the receptor that is transmitted to the bound Gα subunit of the  heterotrimeric G protein via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dynamics#Global_flexibility:_multiple_domains" title="Protein dynamics">protein domain dynamics</a>.  The activated Gα subunit exchanges <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_triphosphate" title="Guanosine triphosphate">GTP</a> in place  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_diphosphate" title="Guanosine diphosphate">GDP</a> which in  turn triggers the dissociation of Gα subunit from the Gβγ  dimer and from the receptor. The dissociated Gα and Gβγ  subunits interact with other intracellular proteins to continue the signal  transduction cascade while the freed GPCR is able to rebind to another  heterotrimeric G protein to form a new complex that is ready to initiate  another round of signal transduction. It is believed  that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_equilibrium" title="Dynamic equilibrium">equilibrium</a> between active and inactive biophysical states. The binding of ligands to the  receptor may shift the equilibrium toward the active receptor states. Three  types of ligands exist: Agonists are ligands that shift the equilibrium in  favour of active states; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_agonist" title="Inverse agonist">inverse agonists</a> are ligands that shift the equilibrium in favour of inactive states; and  neutral antagonists are ligands that do not affect the equilibrium. It is not  yet known how exactly the active and inactive states differ from each other.</p>
      
      <h3>6.3 G-protein  activation/deactivation cycle</h3>
      <p>When the  receptor is inactive, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine_nucleotide_exchange_factor" title="Guanine nucleotide exchange factor">GEF</a> domain may be bound to an also inactive α-subunit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotrimeric_G-protein" title="Heterotrimeric G-protein">heterotrimeric  G-protein</a>. These &quot;G-proteins&quot; are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_trimer" title="Protein trimer">trimer</a> of α, β, and γ subunits (known as Gα, Gβ,  and Gγ, respectively) that is rendered inactive when reversibly bound to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_diphosphate" title="Guanosine diphosphate">Guanosine diphosphate</a> (GDP) (or, alternatively, no guanine nucleotide) but active when bound to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_triphosphate" title="Guanosine triphosphate">Guanosine triphosphate</a> (GTP). Upon receptor activation, the GEF domain, in turn, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosterically" title="Allosterically">allosterically</a> activates the G-protein by  facilitating the exchange of a molecule of GDP for GTP at the G-protein's  α-subunit. The cell maintains a 10:1 ratio of cytosolic GTP:GDP so exchange for  GTP is ensured. At this point, the subunits of the G-protein dissociate from  the receptor, as well as each other, to yield a Gα-GTP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomer" title="Monomer">monomer</a> and a tightly interacting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-gamma_complex" title="Beta-gamma complex">Gβγ dimer</a>, which  are now free to modulate the activity of other intracellular proteins. The  extent to which they may <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse" title="Diffuse">diffuse</a>, however, is limited  due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitoylation" title="Palmitoylation">palmitoylation</a> of Gα  and the presence of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprenoid" title="Isoprenoid">isoprenoid</a> moiety that has  been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond" title="Covalent bond">covalently</a> added to the C-termini of Gγ. Because Gα also  has slow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTP-ase" title="GTP-ase">GTP→GDP hydrolysis</a> capability, the inactive form  of the α-subunit (Gα-GDP) is eventually regenerated, thus allowing  reassociation with a Gβγ dimer to form the &quot;resting&quot; G-protein, which  can again bind to a GPCR and await activation. The rate of GTP hydrolysis is  often accelerated due to the actions of another family of allosteric modulating  proteins called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulator_of_G_protein_signalling" title="Regulator of G protein signalling">Regulators  of G-protein Signaling</a>, or RGS proteins, which are a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTPase_activating_protein" title="GTPase activating protein">GTPase-Activating  Protein</a>, or GAP. In fact, many of the primary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)" title="Effector (biology)">effector</a> proteins (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylate_cyclase" title="Adenylate cyclase">adenylate cyclases</a>)  that become activated/inactivated upon interaction with Gα-GTP also have GAP  activity. Thus, even at this early stage in the process, GPCR-initiated  signaling has the capacity for self-termination.</p>
      
      <h3>6.4 Crosstalk</h3>
      <p>Proposed  downstream interactions between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin" title="Integrin">integrin</a> signaling and  GPCRs. Integrins are shown elevating Ca2+ and phosphorylating FAK,  which is weakening GPCR signaling. GPCRs  downstream signals have been shown to possibly interact with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin" title="Integrin">integrin</a> signals, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTK2" title="PTK2">FAK</a>.  Integrin signaling will phosphorylate FAK, which can then decrease GPCR Gαs  activity.</p>
      
      <h2>7.0 GPCR signaling</h2>
      
     <img src="images/img/G-protein-coupled-receptor.jpg" alt="GPCRs" width="755" height="607" class="img-responsive" style="display: block; margin:auto; margin-bottom: 15px">
    
     <p> If a receptor  in an active state encounters a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein" title="G protein">G protein</a>, it may activate it. Some evidence  suggests that receptors and G proteins are actually pre-coupled. For example, binding of G proteins to  receptors affects the receptor's affinity for ligands. Activated G proteins are  bound to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_triphosphate" title="Guanosine triphosphate">GTP</a>. Further signal  transduction depends on the type of G protein. The enzyme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylate_cyclase" title="Adenylate cyclase">adenylate cyclase</a> is an example of a cellular  protein that can be regulated by a G protein, in this case the G protein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gs_alpha_subunit" title="Gs alpha subunit">Gs</a>. Adenylate cyclase activity is  activated when it binds to a subunit of the activated G protein. Activation of  adenylate cyclase ends when the G protein returns to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_diphosphate" title="Guanosine diphosphate">GDP</a>-bound  state. Adenylate  cyclases (of which 9 membrane-bound and one cytosolic forms are known in  humans) may also be activated or inhibited in other ways (e.g., Ca2+/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calmodulin" title="Calmodulin">Calmodulin</a> binding), which can modify the  activity of these enzymes in an additive or synergistic fashion along with the  G proteins. The signaling  pathways activated through a GPCR are limited by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_primary_structure" title="Protein primary structure">primary sequence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure" title="Tertiary structure">tertiary structure</a> of the GPCR itself but ultimately determined by the particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_conformation" title="Protein conformation">conformation</a> stabilized by a particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)" title="Ligand (biochemistry)">ligand</a>, as  well as the availability of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer" title="Transducer">transducer</a> molecules.  Currently, GPCRs are considered to utilize two primary types of transducers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-proteins" title="G-proteins">G-proteins</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrestin" title="Arrestin">β-arrestins</a>. Because β-arr&rsquo;s have high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)" title="Affinity (pharmacology)">affinity</a> only to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylated" title="Phosphorylated">phosphorylated</a> form of  most GPCRs (see above or below), the majority of signaling is ultimately  dependent upon G-protein activation. However, the possibility for interaction  does allow for G-protein-independent signaling to occur.</p>
      
      <h3>7.1 G-protein-dependent signaling</h3>
      <p>There are three  main G-protein-mediated signaling pathways, mediated by four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)" title="Class (biology)">sub-classes</a> of G-proteins distinguished from each  other by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_homology" title="Sequence homology">sequence homology</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%CE%B1s" title="Gαs">Gαs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%CE%B1i" title="Gαi">Gαi/o</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%CE%B1q" title="Gαq">Gαq/11</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G12/G13_alpha_subunits" title="G12/G13 alpha subunits">Gα12/13</a>).  Each sub-class of G-protein consists of multiple proteins, each the product of  multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genes" title="Genes">genes</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splice_variant" title="Splice variant">splice variations</a> that may imbue them with  differences ranging from subtle to distinct with regard to signaling  properties, but in general they appear reasonably grouped into four classes.  Because the signal transducing properties of the various possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-gamma_complex" title="Beta-gamma complex">βγ combinations</a> do not appear to radically differ from one another, these classes are defined  according to the isoform of their α-subunit. While most  GPCRs are capable of activating more than one Gα-subtype, they also show a  preference for one subtype over another. When the subtype activated depends on  the ligand that is bound to the GPCR, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity" title="Functional selectivity">functional selectivity</a> (also known as agonist-directed trafficking, or conformation-specific agonism).  However, the binding of any single particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist" title="Agonist">agonist</a> may also initiate activation of multiple  different G-proteins, as it may be capable of stabilizing more than one  conformation of the GPCR&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine_nucleotide_exchange_factor" title="Guanine nucleotide exchange factor">GEF</a> domain, even over the course of a single interaction. In addition, a  conformation that preferably activates one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoform" title="Isoform">isoform</a> of Gα may activate another if the  preferred is less available. Furthermore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback" title="Feedback">feedback</a> pathways may result in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification" title="Post-translational modification">receptor  modifications</a> (e.g., phosphorylation) that alter the G-protein  preference. Regardless of these various nuances, the GPCR&rsquo;s preferred coupling  partner is usually defined according to the G-protein most obviously activated  by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous" title="Endogenous">endogenous</a> ligand under most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiological" title="Physiological">physiological</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental" title="Experimental">experimental</a> conditions.</p>
      
      <h4>7.1.1 Gα signaling</h4>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>The       effector of both the Gαs and Gαi/o pathways is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_amp" title="Cyclic amp">cyclic-adenosine monophosphate</a> (cAMP)-generating enzyme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase" title="Adenylyl cyclase">adenylate cyclase</a>,       or AC. While there are ten different AC gene products in mammals, each       with subtle differences in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)" title="Tissue (biology)">tissue</a> distribution and/or function, all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyze" title="Catalyze">catalyze</a> the conversion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosolic" title="Cytosolic">cytosolic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" title="Adenosine triphosphate">adenosine       triphosphate</a> (ATP) to cAMP, and all are directly stimulated by       G-proteins of the Gαs class. In contrast, however, interaction       with Gα subunits of the Gαi/o type inhibits AC from generating       cAMP. Thus, a GPCR coupled to Gαs counteracts the actions of a       GPCR coupled to Gαi/o, and vice versa. The level of cytosolic       cAMP may then determine the activity of various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_nucleotide-gated_ion_channel" title="Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel">ion       channels</a> as well as members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine/threonine-specific_protein_kinase" title="Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase">ser/thr-specific</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_A" title="Protein kinase A">protein kinase A</a> (PKA) family.

Since many isoforms of PKC are also activated by increases in       intracellular Ca2+, both these pathways can also converge on       each other to signal through the same secondary effector. Elevated       intracellular Ca2+ also binds and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosterically" title="Allosterically">allosterically</a> activates proteins called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calmodulin" title="Calmodulin">calmodulins</a>, which in turn go on to bind and       allosterically activate enzymes such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca2%2B/calmodulin-dependent_protein_kinase" title="Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase">Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent       kinases</a> (CAMKs).</li>
      <li>The       effectors of the Gα12/13 pathway are three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RhoGEF_domain" title="RhoGEF domain">RhoGEFs</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=P115-RhoGEF&action=edit&redlink=1" title="P115-RhoGEF (page does not exist)">p115-RhoGEF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PDZ-RhoGEF&action=edit&redlink=1" title="PDZ-RhoGEF (page does not exist)">PDZ-RhoGEF</a>,       and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LARG&action=edit&redlink=1" title="LARG (page does not exist)">LARG</a>),       which, when bound to Gα12/13 allosterically activate the       cytosolic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_GTPase" title="Small GTPase">small GTPase</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho_family_of_GTPases" title="Rho family of GTPases">Rho</a>.       Once bound to GTP, Rho can then go on to activate various proteins       responsible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton" title="Cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a> regulation such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho-associated_protein_kinase" title="Rho-associated protein kinase">Rho-kinase</a> (ROCK). Most GPCRs that couple to Gα12/13 also couple to other       sub-classes, often Gαq/11.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>7.1.2 Gβγ signaling</h4>
      <p>The above  descriptions ignore the effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-gamma_complex" title="Beta-gamma complex">Gβγ</a>–signalling,  which can also be important, in particular in the case of activated Gαi/o-coupled  GPCRs. The primary effectors of Gβγ are various ion channels, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_inwardly-rectifying_potassium_channel" title="G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel">G-protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+  channels</a> (GIRKs), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-type_calcium_channel" title="P-type calcium channel">P</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-type_calcium_channel" title="Q-type calcium channel">Q</a>- and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-type_calcium_channel" title="N-type calcium channel">N-type</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-dependent_calcium_channel" title="Voltage-dependent calcium channel">voltage-gated  Ca2+ channels</a>, as well as some isoforms of AC and PLC,  along with some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PI3K" title="PI3K">phosphoinositide-3-kinase</a> (PI3K) isoforms.</p>
      
      <h3>7.2 G-protein-independent signaling</h3>
      <p>Although they  are classically thought of working only together, GPCRs may signal through  G-protein-independent mechanisms, and heterotrimeric G-proteins may play  functional roles independent of GPCRs. GPCRs may signal independently through  many proteins already mentioned for their roles in G-protein-dependent  signaling such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrestin" title="Arrestin">β-arrs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor_kinase" title="G protein-coupled receptor kinase">GRKs</a>,  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)" title="Src (gene)">Srcs</a>. In addition, further scaffolding proteins  involved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcellular_localization" title="Subcellular localization">subcellular  localization</a> of GPCRs (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDZ_(biology)" title="PDZ (biology)">PDZ-domain</a>-containing proteins) may also act as  signal transducers. Most often the effector is a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK" title="MAPK">MAPK</a> family.</p>
      
      <h4>7.2.1 Examples</h4>
      <p>In the late  1990s, evidence began accumulating to suggest that some GPCRs are able to  signal without G proteins. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK1" title="MAPK1">ERK2</a> mitogen-activated protein  kinase, a key signal transduction mediator downstream of receptor activation in  many pathways, has been shown to be activated in response to cAMP-mediated  receptor activation in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_mold" title="Slime mold">slime mold</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictyostelium_discoideum" title="Dictyostelium discoideum"><em>D. discoideum</em></a> despite the absence of the associated G protein α- and β-subunits.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein%E2%80%93coupled_receptor#cite_note-49">[49]</a> In mammalian  cells, the much-studied β2-adrenoceptor has been demonstrated to  activate the ERK2 pathway after arrestin-mediated uncoupling of  G-protein-mediated signaling. Therefore, it seems likely that some mechanisms  previously believed related purely to receptor desensitisation are actually  examples of receptors switching their signaling pathway, rather than simply  being switched off. In kidney  cells, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradykinin_receptor_B2" title="Bradykinin receptor B2">bradykinin receptor B2</a> has been shown to interact directly with a protein tyrosine phosphatase. The  presence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoreceptor_tyrosine-based_inhibitory_motif" title="Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif">ITIM</a> (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) sequence in the B2 receptor is  necessary to mediate this interaction and subsequently the antiproliferative  effect of bradykinin.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein%E2%80%93coupled_receptor#cite_note-50">[50]</a></p>
      
      <h4>7.2.2 GPCR-independent signaling by  heterotrimeric G-proteins</h4>
      <p>Although it is  a relatively immature area of research, it appears that heterotrimeric  G-proteins may also take part in non-GPCR signaling. There is evidence for  roles as signal transducers in nearly all other types of receptor-mediated  signaling, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrins" title="Integrins">integrins</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_tyrosine_kinases" title="Receptor tyrosine kinases">receptor tyrosine  kinases</a> (RTKs), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_receptors" title="Cytokine receptors">cytokine receptors</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAK-STAT_signaling_pathway" title="JAK-STAT signaling pathway">JAK/STATs</a>),  as well as modulation of various other &quot;accessory&quot; proteins such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine_nucleotide_exchange_factor" title="Guanine nucleotide exchange factor">GEFs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_nucleotide_dissociation_inhibitors" title="Guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors">Guanine-nucleotide  Dissociation Inhibitors</a> (GDIs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_phosphatases" title="Protein phosphatases">protein phosphatases</a>.  There may even be specific proteins of these classes whose primary function is  as part of GPCR-independent pathways, termed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Activators_of_G-protein_Signalling&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Activators of G-protein Signalling (page does not exist)">Activators of G-protein Signalling</a> (AGS). Both  the ubiquity of these interactions and the importance of Gα vs. Gβγ subunits to  these processes are still unclear.</p>
      
      <h2>8.0 Details of cAMP and PIP2  pathways</h2>
      <h3>8.1 cAMP signal pathway</h3>
      <p>The cAMP signal  transduction contains 5 main characters: stimulative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone" title="Hormone">hormone</a> receptor (Rs) or inhibitory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_receptor" title="Hormone receptor">hormone receptor</a> (Ri); stimulative regulative  G-protein (Gs) or inhibitory regulative G-protein (Gi); <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase" title="Adenylyl cyclase">adenylyl cyclase</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Kinase_A" title="Protein Kinase A">protein kinase A (PKA)</a>; and cAMP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodiesterase" title="Phosphodiesterase">phosphodiesterase</a>. Stimulative  hormone receptor (Rs) is a receptor that can bind with stimulative signal  molecules, while inhibitory hormone receptor (Ri) is a receptor that can bind  with inhibitory signal molecules. Stimulative  regulative G-protein is a G-protein linked to stimulative hormone receptor  (Rs), and its α subunit upon activation could stimulate the activity of an  enzyme or other intracellular metabolism. On the contrary, inhibitory  regulative G-protein is linked to an inhibitory hormone receptor, and its α subunit  upon activation could inhibit the activity of an enzyme or other intracellular  metabolism. Adenylyl  cyclase is a 12-transmembrane glycoprotein that catalyzes ATP to form cAMP with  the help of cofactor Mg2+ or Mn2+. The cAMP produced is a  second messenger in cellular metabolism and is an allosteric activator of  protein kinase A. Protein kinase  A is an important enzyme in cell metabolism due to its ability to regulate cell  metabolism by phosphorylating specific committed enzymes in the metabolic  pathway. It can also regulate specific gene expression, cellular secretion, and  membrane permeability. The protein enzyme contains two catalytic subunits and  two regulatory subunits. When there is no cAMP，the complex is inactive. When cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits, their  conformation is altered, causing the dissociation of the regulatory subunits,  which activates protein kinase A and allows further biological effects. These signals  then can be terminated by cAMP phosphodiesterase, which is an enzyme that  degrades cAMP to 5'-AMP and inactivates protein kinase A.</p>
      
      <h3>8.2 Phosphatidylinositol signal  pathway</h3>
      <p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol" title="Phosphatidylinositol">phosphatidylinositol</a> signal pathway, the extracellular signal molecule binds with the G-protein  receptor (Gq) on the cell surface and activates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_C" title="Phospholipase C">phospholipase C</a>, which is located on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane" title="Cell membrane">plasma membrane</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase" title="Lipase">lipase</a> hydrolyzes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol_4,5-bisphosphate" title="Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate">phosphatidylinositol  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)</a> into two second messengers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate" title="Inositol trisphosphate">inositol  1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacylglycerol" title="Diacylglycerol">diacylglycerol (DAG)</a>. IP3 binds with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP3_receptor" title="IP3 receptor">IP3 receptor</a> in the membrane of the smooth  endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to open Ca2+ channels. DAG  helps activate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Kinase_C" title="Protein Kinase C">protein kinase C (PKC)</a>,  which phosphorylates many other proteins, changing their catalytic activities,  leading to cellular responses. The effects of  Ca2+ are also remarkable: it cooperates with DAG in activating PKC  and can activate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca2%2B/calmodulin-dependent_protein_kinase" title="Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase">CaM  kinase</a> pathway, in which calcium-modulated protein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calmodulin" title="Calmodulin">calmodulin</a> (CaM) binds Ca2+, undergoes  a change in conformation, and activates CaM kinase II, which has unique ability  to increase its binding affinity to CaM by autophosphorylation, making CaM  unavailable for the activation of other enzymes. The kinase then phosphorylates  target enzymes, regulating their activities. The two signal pathways are  connected together by Ca2+-CaM, which is also a regulatory subunit  of adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase in the cAMP signal pathway.</p>
      
      <h2>9.0 Receptor regulation</h2>
      <p>GPCRs become  desensitized when exposed to their ligand for a prolonged period of time. There  are two recognized forms of desensitization: 1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_desensitization" title="Homologous desensitization">homologous  desensitization</a>, in which the activated GPCR is downregulated; and  2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous_desensitization" title="Heterologous desensitization">heterologous  desensitization</a>, wherein the activated GPCR causes downregulation of  a different GPCR. The key reaction of this downregulation is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation" title="Phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> of the intracellular (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm" title="Cytoplasm">cytoplasmic</a>) receptor domain by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase" title="Protein kinase">protein kinases</a>.</p>
      
      <h3>9.1 Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent  protein kinases</h3>
      <p>Cyclic  AMP-dependent protein kinases (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_A" title="Protein kinase A">protein kinase A</a>) are activated by the signal  chain coming from the G protein (that was activated by the receptor) via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenylate_cyclase" title="Adenylate cyclase">adenylate cyclase</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_AMP" title="Cyclic AMP">cyclic AMP</a> (cAMP). In a <em>feedback mechanism</em>,  these activated kinases phosphorylate the receptor. The longer the receptor  remains active the more kinases are activated and the more receptors are  phosphorylated. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-2_adrenergic_receptor" title="Beta-2 adrenergic receptor">β2-adrenoceptors</a>,  this phosphorylation results in the switching of the coupling from the Gs  class of G-protein to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gi_alpha_subunit" title="Gi alpha subunit">Gi</a> class. cAMP-dependent PKA mediated  phosphorylation can cause heterologous desensitisation in receptors other than  those activated. </p>
      
      <h3>9.2 Phosphorylation by GRKs</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor_kinases" title="G protein-coupled receptor kinases">G  protein-coupled receptor kinases</a> (GRKs) are protein kinases that  phosphorylate only active GPCRs.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein%E2%80%93coupled_receptor#cite_note-Trimarco2013-53">[53]</a> G-protein-coupled receptor kinases  (GRKs) are key modulators of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. They  constitute a family of seven mammalian serine-threonine protein kinases that  phosphorylate agonist-bound receptor. GRKs-mediated receptor phosphorylation  rapidly initiates profound impairment of receptor signaling and  desensitization. Activity of GRKs and subcellular targeting is tightly  regulated by interaction with receptor domains, G protein subunits, lipids,  anchoring proteins and calcium-sensitive proteins. Phosphorylation  of the receptor can have two consequences:</p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li><em>Translocation</em>: The       receptor is, along with the part of the membrane it is embedded in,       brought to the inside of the cell, where it is dephosphorylated within the       acidic vesicular environment and then brought back. This mechanism is used       to regulate long-term exposure, for example, to a hormone, by allowing       resensitisation to follow desensitisation. Alternatively, the receptor may       undergo lysozomal degradation, or remain internalised, where it is thought       to participate in the initiation of signalling events, the nature of which       depending on the internalised vesicle's subcellular localisation. </li>
        <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrestin" title="Arrestin">Arrestin</a> linking</em>: The phosphorylated receptor can       be linked to <em>arrestin</em> molecules that prevent it from binding (and       activating) G proteins, in effect switching it off for a short period of       time. This mechanism is used, for example, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin" title="Rhodopsin">rhodopsin</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina" title="Retina">retina</a> cells to compensate for exposure to       bright light. In many cases, arrestin's binding to the receptor is a       prerequisite for translocation. For example, beta-arrestin bound to β2-adrenoreceptors       acts as an adaptor for binding with clathrin, and with the beta-subunit of       AP2 (clathrin adaptor molecules); thus, the arrestin here acts as a       scaffold assembling the components needed for clathrin-mediated       endocytosis of β2-adrenoreceptors. </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>9.3 Mechanisms of GPCR signal  termination</h3>
      <p>As mentioned  above, G-proteins may terminate their own activation due to their intrinsic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTPase" title="GTPase">GTP→GDP hydrolysis</a> capability. However, this  reaction proceeds at a slow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_constant" title="Rate constant">rate</a> (≈.02 times/sec) and, thus, it would take  around 50 seconds for any single G-protein to deactivate if other factors did  not come into play. Indeed, there are around 30 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform" title="Protein isoform">isoforms</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulator_of_G_protein_signalling" title="Regulator of G protein signalling">RGS proteins</a> that, when bound to Gα through their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTPase_activating_protein" title="GTPase activating protein">GAP domain</a>,  accelerate the hydrolysis rate to ≈30 times/sec. This 1500-fold increase in  rate allows for the cell to respond to external signals with high speed, as  well as spatial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution" title="Angular resolution">resolution</a> due  to limited amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_messenger" title="Second messenger">second messenger</a> that can be generated and limited distance a G-protein can diffuse in .03  seconds. For the most part, the RGS proteins are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous" title="Promiscuous">promiscuous</a> in their ability to activate  G-proteins, while which RGS is involved in a given signaling pathway seems more  determined by the tissue and GPCR involved than anything else. In addition, RGS  proteins have the additional function of increasing the rate of GTP-GDP exchange  at GPCRs, (i.e., as a sort of co-GEF) further contributing to the time  resolution of GPCR signaling. In addition,  the GPCR may be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_desensitization" title="Homologous desensitization">desensitized</a> itself. This can occur as:</p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>a direct       result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_theory" title="Receptor theory">ligand occupation</a>,       wherein the change in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_conformation" title="Protein conformation">conformation</a> allows recruitment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor_kinase" title="G protein-coupled receptor kinase">GPCR-Regulating       Kinases</a> (GRKs), which go on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation" title="Phosphorylation">phosphorylate</a> various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine" title="Serine">serine</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine" title="Threonine">threonine</a> residues of IL-3 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-terminal" title="C-terminal">C-terminal</a> tail. Upon GRK phosphorylation,       the GPCR's affinity for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrestin" title="Arrestin">β-arrestin</a> (β-arrestin-1/2 in most tissues) is increased, at which point β-arrestin       may bind and act to both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterically" title="Sterically">sterically</a> hinder       G-protein coupling as well as initiate the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor-mediated_endocytosis" title="Receptor-mediated endocytosis">receptor       internalization</a> through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrin-mediated_endocytosis" title="Clathrin-mediated endocytosis">clathrin-mediated       endocytosis</a>. Because only the liganded receptor is desensitized       by this mechanism, it is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_desensitization" title="Homologous desensitization">homologous       desensitization</a></li>
      <li>the       affinity for β-arrestin may be increased in a ligand occupation and       GRK-independent manner through phosphorylation of different ser/thr sites       (but also of IL-3 and the C-terminal tail) by PKC and PKA. These       phosphorylations are often sufficient to impair G-protein coupling on       their own as well.</li>
      <li>PKC/PKA       may, instead, phosphorylate GRKs, which can also lead to GPCR       phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding in an occupation-independent       manner. These latter two mechanisms allow for desensitization of one GPCR       due to the activities of others, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous_desensitization" title="Heterologous desensitization">heterologous       desensitization</a>. GRKs may also have GAP domains and so may       contribute to inactivation through non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase" title="Kinase">kinase</a> mechanisms as well. A combination of       these mechanisms may also occur.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once β-arrestin  is bound to a GPCR, it undergoes a conformational change allowing it to serve  as a scaffolding protein for an adaptor complex termed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP2_adaptors" title="AP2 adaptors">AP-2</a>, which in turn recruits another protein  called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrin" title="Clathrin">clathrin</a>. If enough receptors in the local area  recruit clathrin in this manner, they aggregate and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_membrane" title="Plasma membrane">membrane</a> buds inwardly as a result of  interactions between the molecules of clathrin, in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsonization" title="Opsonization">opsonization</a>. Once the pit has been pinched off  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_membrane" title="Plasma membrane">plasma membrane</a> due  to the actions of two other proteins called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiphysin" title="Amphiphysin">amphiphysin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamin" title="Dynamin">dynamin</a>, it is now an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis" title="Endocytosis">endocytic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology)" title="Vesicle (biology)">vesicle</a>. At this point, the adapter molecules and  clathrin have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociated" title="Dissociated">dissociated</a>, and the  receptor is either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_targeting" title="Protein targeting">trafficked</a> back  to the plasma membrane or targeted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosomes" title="Lysosomes">lysosomes</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis" title="Proteolysis">degradation</a>. At any point in  this process, the β-arrestins may also recruit other proteins—such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-receptor_tyrosine_kinase" title="Non-receptor tyrosine kinase">non-receptor  tyrosine kinase</a> (nRTK), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)" title="Src (gene)">c-SRC</a>—which may activate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases" title="Extracellular signal-regulated kinases">ERK1/2</a>,  or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase" title="Mitogen-activated protein kinase">mitogen-activated  protein kinase</a> (MAPK) signaling through, for example,  phosphorylation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_GTPase" title="Small GTPase">small GTP-ase</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily" title="Ras subfamily">Ras</a>, or recruit the proteins of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK/ERK_pathway" title="MAPK/ERK pathway">ERK cascade</a> directly (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raf-1" title="Raf-1">Raf-1</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase" title="Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase">MEK</a>,  ERK-1/2) at which point signaling is initiated due to their close proximity to  one another. Another target of c-SRC are the dynamin molecules involved in  endocytosis. Dynamins <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization" title="Polymerization">polymerize</a> around the  neck of an incoming vesicle, and their phosphorylation by c-SRC provides the  energy necessary for the conformational change allowing the final  &quot;pinching off&quot; from the membrane.</p>
      
      <h3>9.4 GPCR cellular regulation</h3>
      <p>Receptor  desensitization is mediated through a combination phosphorylation, β-arr  binding, and endocytosis as described above. Downregulation occurs when  endocytosed receptor is embedded in an endosome that is trafficked to merge  with an organelle called a lysosome. Because lysosomal membranes are rich in  proton pumps, their interiors have low pH (≈4.8 vs. the pH≈7.2 cytosol), which  acts to denature the GPCRs. In addition, lysosomes contain many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degradative_enzyme" title="Degradative enzyme">degradative enzymes</a>,  including proteases, which can function only at such low pH, and so the peptide  bonds joining the residues of the GPCR together may be cleaved. Whether or not  a given receptor is trafficked to a lysosome, detained in endosomes, or  trafficked back to the plasma membrane depends on a variety of factors,  including receptor type and magnitude of the signal. GPCR regulation is  additionally mediated by gene transcription factors. These factors can increase  or decrease gene transcription and thus increase or decrease the generation of  new receptors (up- or down-regulation) that travel to the cell membrane.</p>
      
    <h2>10.0 Receptor oligomerization</h2>
      <p>G-protein-coupled  receptor oligomerisation is a widespread phenomenon. One of the best-studied  examples is the metabotropic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAB_receptor" title="GABAB receptor">GABAB receptor</a>. This so-called  constitutive receptor is formed by heterodimerization of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABBR1" title="GABBR1">GABABR1</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABBR2" title="GABBR2">GABABR2</a> subunits. Expression of the  GABABR1 without the GABABR2 in heterologous systems leads  to retention of the subunit in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum" title="Endoplasmic reticulum">endoplasmic reticulum</a>.  Expression of the GABABR2 subunit alone, meanwhile, leads to surface  expression of the subunit, although with no functional activity (i.e., the  receptor does not bind agonist and cannot initiate a response following  exposure to agonist). Expression of the two subunits together leads to plasma  membrane expression of functional receptor. It has been shown that GABABR2  binding to GABABR1 causes masking of a retention signal of  functional receptors. </p>
      
    <h2>11.0 Origin and diversification of  the superfamily</h2>
      <p>Signal  transduction mediated by the superfamily of GPCRs dates back to the origin of  multicellularity. Mammalian-like GPCRs are found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi" title="Fungi">fungi</a>,  and have been classified according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRAFS" title="GRAFS">GRAFS</a> classification system based on GPCR fingerprints. Identification of the  superfamily members across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic" title="Eukaryotic">eukaryotic</a> domain, and comparison of the  family-specific motifs, have shown that the superfamily of GPCRs have a common  origin. Characteristic motifs indicate that three of the five GRAFS families, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin" title="Rhodopsin">Rhodopsin</a></em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion-GPCRs" title="Adhesion-GPCRs"><em>Adhesion</em></a>, and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frizzled" title="Frizzled">Frizzled</a></em>, evolved from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictyostelium" title="Dictyostelium">Dictyostelium</a> discoideum</em> cAMP receptors  before the split of Opisthokonts. Later, the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretin" title="Secretin">Secretin</a></em> family evolved from the <em>Adhesion</em> GPCR receptor family before the split of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode" title="Nematode">nematodes</a>.</p>
